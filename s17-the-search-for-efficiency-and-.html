        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_p01">The <em class="emphasis">small</em> in small business refers only to the number of employees or the volume of sales. It seldom refers to the level of enthusiasm, the amount of creativity, or the ability to innovate. A great example of this is Carrot Creative, a new social media agency headquartered in the Dumbo section of Brooklyn, New York. Mike Germano and Robert Gaafar started their first company while Mike was a college student and serving as a city councilman in Hamden, Connecticut. They developed sites that enabled students to sell used textbooks and rate their professors. In 2005, they opened Carrot Creative. When it was in its infancy, Carrot Creative was not a traditional marketing agency, and social media barely existed. The social media industry, as a whole, is one of the most innovative and fast-paced industries in the world, forcing companies such as Carrot Creative to stay ahead of the curve and adapt quickly.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_p02">From the very beginning, Carrot Creative has been innovative and progressive—not only because of its founders and team members but also out of necessity. It started with no available business model to copy, no rules to follow, and no resources on which to rely. They had one rule: do not accept the status quo. Carrot Creative was designed to become what its founders envisioned and what the market needed. They view themselves as a business that is always open to a challenge. They dare anyone to present them with a problem that they cannot solve. Germano, in a recent interview, put it this way, “We help brands build on social networks, teach them and help them in great ways for them to have conversations with their customers and really turn brands into people.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_001">Julie Kanfer, “Brooklyn Tech: Carrot Creative’s Mike Germano,” <em class="emphasis">Brooklyn Heights Blog</em>, May 14, 2010, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/18448">brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/18448</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_p03">Some of the brands that they have signed include Crayola, the National Football League, Major League Baseball, AOL, Disney, PepsiCo, Budweiser, the Islands of the Bahamas, and Ford Motor Company. Creative Carrot was the driving force behind Ford’s social media campaign for its new Fiesta vehicle. This <em class="emphasis">small</em> business has partnerships with some of the world’s largest advertising agencies and public relations (PR) firms. They also have the honor to be on the forefront of designing the very tools that define social media. They view their title as an official “Facebook Preferred Developer” as just icing on the cake.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_p04">Today, Carrot Creative remains on top of the creative game by giving all its employees the freedom to create in their own way. It keeps creativity flowing by cultivating an environment and culture that removes the idea of micromanaging and gives each Carrot Creative employee the freedom, trust, and responsibility for their own work and actions. One never knows when creativity will strike, but it certainly will not be inside a cubicle or under someone’s thumb. Creativity flows through individual expression and personal work style. The Carrot Creative office is designed for just those things. There is space to work on couches, in a room of Astroturf, and private offices with maple desks, and, most importantly, the ability to be freely collaborative. As Germano said, “We appreciate the individual nature of small companies.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_002">Julie Kanfer, “Brooklyn Tech: Carrot Creative’s Mike Germano,” <em class="emphasis">Brooklyn Heights Blog</em>, May 14, 2010, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/18448">brooklynheightsblog.com/archives/18448</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_p01">Open any basic management textbook, and there will always be a discussion of the importance for an organization to be both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">effective</a><span class="glossdef">Achieving the outcomes that someone wishes to produce.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">efficient</a><span class="glossdef">Producing the desired results with the minimum expenditure of energy, time, money, personnel, or material.</span></span>. These are fundamental concepts.

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_p02">It is important to recognize that for any given endeavor, one can be effective and but not efficient and vice versa. This can be illustrated with the following example. Two students are working in their college mail room. Each is given a stack of five hundred individual class schedules that are to be sorted and placed in the mailboxes of the undergraduate students. They are told that when they are done, they will be given another job. The first student is meticulous and carefully checks that each class schedule goes to the right recipient. She completes the job in 4.5 hours. The second student is less careful about accuracy and makes several errors by putting the wrong schedule in the wrong box. However, he completes his work in 3 hours. The first student was effective because the task was to get the right schedule to the right student. The second student was more efficient, if efficiency is measured in the number of schedules dispensed per hour.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_p03">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, two important works on the nature of a firm introduced an expanded concept known as “organizational slack.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_006">James G. March and Herbert A. Simon, <em class="emphasis">Organizations</em> (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1958), 46; Richard M. Cyert and James G. March, <em class="emphasis">A Behavioral Theory of the Firm</em> (Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1963), 121.</span> Slack was seen as the excess capacity maintained by an organization. By definition, slack implies that an organization is not perfectly efficient. Some argue that slack provides resources for innovation and change. Others see it as a buffer for a firm.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_007">Joseph L. C. Cheng and Idalene F. Kesner, “Organizational Slack and Response to Environmental Shifts: The Impact of Resource Allocation Patterns,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management</em> 23, no. 1 (1997): 1–18.</span> Although these debates might make for interesting academic discussions, it must be recognized that most small businesses do not have the luxury of maintaining any appreciable slack. Their survival hinges on being <em class="emphasis">both</em> highly effective and highly efficient. Therefore, any technique, program, or methodology that improves those ends is vital to the well-being of a small business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p01">Throughout this chapter, the focus will be on the simple fact that one of the great enemies in life—particularly a businessperson’s life—is the existence and acceptance of waste. One of the resources that we can least afford to waste is time. In many ways, time is the most precious of all resources. Other resources can often be purchased or acquired, but time cannot be purchased. Once lost, time can never be recaptured. Time, as a resource, should be of particular importance for the small business owner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p02">If one is serious about maximizing the use of time, then one should consider two venues: use a time-management system and avoid what are referred to as “time wasters.” The term <em class="emphasis">time-management system</em> is a broad concept and covers many different approaches. Regardless of the approach used, its adoption provides multiple benefits. As one author puts it—“‘<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Time management</a><span class="glossdef">Working on the right things (effectiveness) and doing them the best way (efficiency).</span></span>’ involves working on the right things [effectiveness] and doing them the best way [efficiency].”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_009">Peggy Duncan, <em class="emphasis">The Time Management Memory Jogger</em> (Salem, NH: Goal/QPC Publishers, 2008), xi.</span> Steven Covey, author of <em class="emphasis">First Things First</em>,<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_010">Steven Covey, A.

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">third-generation time-management system</a><span class="glossdef">A system that incorporates a system of prioritization to tasks that must be done.</span></span> incorporates task prioritization. Many businesspeople are familiar with paper-and-pencil or computerized systems for listing tasks, noting their due dates, and prioritizing them in terms of relative importance. Covey argues for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fourth-generation time-management system</a><span class="glossdef">A system designed to bring balance into the personal and professional life of an individual.</span></span>. This system is designed to bring balance into the personal and the professional lives of individuals. It is best illustrated by Covey’s 2 × 2 matrix, where one axis is composed of tasks that can be categorized as <em class="emphasis">urgent</em> or <em class="emphasis">not urgent</em>. The other axis is composed of tasks that can be characterized as either <em class="emphasis">important</em> or <em class="emphasis">not important</em> (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_f01">Figure 13.1 "Time-Management Matrix"</a>). He emphasizes that those tasks that might be found in the <em class="emphasis">important/not urgent</em> quadrant (quadrant 2) might be critical to an individual’s well-being. Unfortunately, because they are listed as <em class="emphasis">not urgent</em>, they might fall by the wayside. His goal is to produce a “balanced manager.” This balance refers to what he argues are the four fundamental human needs: physical needs, social needs, mental needs, and spiritual needs. His approach to time management is based on valuing relationships and recognizing that the proper management of relationships will reduce the amount of time wasted in activities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p03">Covey advocates that an individual should have a deep understanding of what is important in one’s life and recognize that, on any day, one will assume different roles. Both elements need to be incorporated into the time-management system. For Covey, we all have to assume different roles in our personal and professional lives. The objective is to identify what these roles require time-wise and how they can be successfully integrated. To achieve integration, we need to better understand ourselves. Covey suggests that developing a personal mission statement is vital to achieving balance. Some characteristics of such a statement might include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>What represents the deepest and best within a person?</li>
            <li>What is an expression of a person’s unique capacity to contribute to one’s family, the organization, and the world at large?</li>
            <li>What represents pursuits that are higher than self-interest?</li>
            <li>What integrates all four fundamental human needs?</li>
            <li>What principles produce quality-of-life results?</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p17">Covey’s complete system of time management is comprehensive and is supported by both paper-and-pencil and software support materials.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p18">If Covey’s comprehensive approach appears to be initially overwhelming, where else might a person begin to improve their time-management skills? An excellent—in fact a critical—takeoff point would be to ask the following question: “Where has the time gone?” How often have we asked ourselves or heard others pose this question, and how often are we unable to answer it? Until one has a solid idea of how time is spent, it is impossible to manage time effectively. It is comparable to beginning a journey to a location without knowing the exact starting point. An excellent way of knowing how time is spent is to use an activity log.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p19">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">activity log</a><span class="glossdef">A technique that involves writing down every task and activity that one is involved with during a day.</span></span> involves writing down every task and activity a person is involved with during a day. It also requires noting when these activities occurred during the day and how long they lasted. It would be very useful to also comment on one’s emotional state and energy level while performing these tasks and activities. The log should be maintained for a period of time—generally one or two weeks. At the end of this period, analyze how time was spent. This analysis should look for some common threads:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_l05">
            <li>How much time per day or week is spent on particular activities?</li>
            <li>When during the day did you feel the most productive?</li>
            <li>When during the day did you feel the least productive or have the most disruptions to workflow?</li>
            <li>What activities were individuals who created these disruptions to workflow?</li>
            <li>What activities seem to provide little or no value?</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p20">The goal of this analysis is to identify what task or activity should be eliminated and when, if there is a pattern to productivity, a high-value challenging task should be scheduled.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p22">In addition to identifying these tasks, it is vital that a person prioritize these tasks. Some tasks are clearly more important than others. As an example, securing a major sale would have a much higher priority than selecting the appropriate stationery for a business. The next step is determining—or more likely estimating—how much time and what resources will be required to complete the tasks. Use these estimates of time to generate a to-do list specifying the completion date for the tasks and the activities. Plan on working within realistic blocks of time.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_014">Susan Giurleo, “11 Time Management Tips for Small Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">DrSusanGiurleo.com</em>, April 11, 2011, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success">drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success</a>.</span> When dealing with a large complex project, learn to break it down into manageable segments and components.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to “chunk.”</strong> Chunking is a process by which similar activities are grouped into common blocks of time.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to delegate.</strong> A common complaint leveled at entrepreneurs and small business owners is their propensity to be involved in every aspect of the business. The effective use of one’s time will involve recognizing that one person cannot do everything. It is important to learn how to delegate a particular task to subordinates. The challenge is to properly supervise the subordinates so that the task is carried out as desired.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_017">Susan Giurleo, “11 Time Management Tips for Small Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">DrSusanGiurleo.com</em>, April 11, 2011, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success">drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success</a>.</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to say “no.”</strong> It is often said that the most important word for a manager to learn is the word <em class="emphasis">no</em>. Time management involves discipline. It means that at times we must stop activities that would become time robbers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_018">Carol Halsey, “The Greatest Technique of Time Management,” <em class="emphasis">PowerHomeBiz.com</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol94/time.htm">www.powerhomebiz.com/vol94/time.htm</a>.</span> What about the colleague who drifts into your work space and asks, “Do you have a few minutes?” When we know that this colleague will be talking more about his or her own personal life rather than work-related activities, then we must have the courage to say, “Sorry, but I do not have the time.” In periods of time pressure, we must even find strength to forgo some activities, such as going out to lunch.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_019">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to not procrastinate.</strong> For many of us, this is the great challenge. It is best dealt with by maintaining a clear focus on the required tasks. This is why a to-do list of tasks tied with prioritization is so important. One way to deal with procrastination is to concentrate on one task and staying with the task until it is complete.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_020">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span> Another form of procrastination is the willing acceptance of wasting time.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to manage e-mail.</strong> One of the greatest sources of time wasting is the improper management of e-mail. The ping announcing a new e-mail message often lures one away from productive work to read the message. One should plan set blocks of time during the day to handle e-mail.

It is a great tragedy that we often think of creativity and innovation in terms of new technologies only. We fail to realize that creativity and innovation can occur anywhere within a business. There is a story—perhaps it is an urban legend—about a member of the cleaning staff for a company that manufactures shampoo. This employee brought a suggestion to the attention of an executive on the marketing team. The employee pointed out that the instructions on the back of the bottle of shampoo said—“Lather and rinse” and suggested that it should read “Lather, rinse, and repeat.” It may be apocryphal and somewhat unethical, but, if true, it would have led to a significant increase in sales. We recount this legend not to advocate any form of chicanery but to point out that creative insights may come from anyone and anywhere. Creativity is not limited to scientists, engineers, designers, or top executives. It is a property that all human beings possess. Likewise, creativity need not be singularly channeled into new high-tech products or advanced designs. Innovation may pursue different strategies. There are three fundamental innovation strategies for firms: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">need seeker</a><span class="glossdef">A firm that actively interacts with its present and future customers and carefully listens to them so that it can develop new products and services.</span></span>, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">market reader</a><span class="glossdef">A firm that maintains a close relationship with its customers and provides them value through small innovative changes.</span></span>, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">technology driver</a><span class="glossdef">A business that puts money into research and development to produce revolutionary breakthroughs and/or incremental changes.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_035">Barry Jaruzelski and Kevin Dehoff, “The Global Innovation 1000: How the Top Innovators Keep Winning,” <em class="emphasis">Strategy+Business (Booz &amp; Company)</em>, November 3, 2010, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.strategy-business.com/article/10408?gko=08375">www.strategy-business.com/article/10408?gko=08375</a>.</span> Need seeker firms actively interact with their present and future customers and carefully listen to them so that they can develop new products and services. These firms tend to be the first in the market. A market reader firm maintains a close relationship with its customers and provides them value through small innovative changes. A technology-driven firm is a business that puts money into research and development to produce revolutionary breakthroughs and/or incremental changes. Such a firm spends more time and effort in anticipating future customer needs and carefully listening to what customers believe they want at this point in time. None of these three innovation strategies is clearly superior to the other. It is interesting to know, however, that none of these strategies precludes or minimizes the potential contribution that could come from a small business. If one examines the three innovation strategies, it could be clearly argued that small businesses have an advantage over their larger rivals for the first two strategies. Both rely on a business having a deep and intimate understanding of the needs and desires of its customers. Small businesses also are better positioned to actively listen to their customers and, because of their size, respond more rapidly. Even the third innovation strategy often is the domain of the smaller business. Think of the number of technological breakthroughs that were initiated by smaller firms (at least, smaller at that time) than the large behemoths.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s02_p03">At one level, creativity should be thought of as a rare flower that should be nurtured at both the individual level and the organizational level. Many businesses create an environment that not only does not foster creativity among its personnel but also actively crushes it. Such firms punish any failure, which increases fear in the personnel to try something new. These firms fail to reward innovative successes. They foster groupthink, often responding with the following reply: “We have always done it this way.” The leadership team believes that leaders are the only ones responsible for creative actions. This type of organization is toxic to creativity.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Accepting the belief that one may not be creative.</strong> At a recent sports event, the coach of the team wore a t-shirt that had the following saying: “If you believe you can do something or if you believe you can’t do something, you are right.” Individuals who tell themselves that they are not creative are producing a self-fulfilling prophecy. They will not even attempt to break through barriers that might preclude them from having brilliant, creative, and innovative ideas. It is absolutely vital for the small business owner to be open to the possibility of his or her own tremendous creativity.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Acceptance of the current situation.</strong> Sometimes we assume that the current situation is not only fully acceptable but also the only way that it can be. With that type of mental framework, we never will be in a position even to ask, “How could the situation be made better?” This corresponds with the old idiom, “If it ain’t broke, don’t fix it.” A creative mind is always operating under the assumption that things can be different and can be made better.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Self-censorship.</strong> This is a situation when an idea occurs to us, but we initially consider it too outlandish or too impractical to successfully implement. We dismiss the idea without any further consideration. One does not even take the opportunity to record the idea. We engage in self-sabotage of our own creativity by dismissing our own ideas out of hand.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Allowing ideas to die.</strong> It is not enough to have a creative idea. One must have the courage to defend the idea and the fortitude to see it through to fruition. Unfortunately, individuals adopt the philosophy of W. C. Fields: “If at first you don’t succeed, try, try again. Then quit. No use being a damn fool about it.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_036">“W. C. Fields Quotes,” <em class="emphasis">Goodreads</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/82951.W_C_Fields">www.goodreads.com/author/quotes/82951.W_C_Fields</a>.</span> A good counterexample of this failure to pursue ideas is the genesis of FedEx. Fred Smith, FedEx’s CEO and founder, was an economics major at Yale University. While there in 1965, Smith wrote a term paper outlining the concept behind FedEx. Legend has it that this paper received a grade of C. Most students would feel that this grade was a clear indication that the concept was infeasible, but Fred Smith was not persuaded, and nine years later he began FedEx. It is not enough to be creative; one also must be courageous.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Not maintaining a record of ideas.</strong> What is called inspiration may be rather fickle. Ideas may come to us in the most unlikely of places and at unexpected times. Individuals should be prepared to make note of these ideas as they come. It might simply require having a notepad available at all times or a digital recorder to take down ideas. Sometimes it is useful to write out the ideas, place them where they are visually accessible, and return to them at some point in the future.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s02_p05">Perhaps one of the most commonly used creativity tools is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">brainstorming</a><span class="glossdef">A group process by which individuals produce solutions to problems without any restriction placed on their possible options.</span></span>, an approach that emphasizes collaboration within a group. Brainstorming begins by specifying a problem or issue—for example, “How can we boost sales at the restaurant?”; “What can be done to reduce customer complaints?”; or “Why do these particular types of defects keep occurring?” Then one brings together personnel who are directly familiar with the problem or the issue. Sometimes it might be advisable to bring in people not directly familiar with the problem or the issue because they may bring a totally different perspective that might enhance the overall creativity of the problem-solving exercise. The room where the brainstorming exercise is held should be equipped with a whiteboard, or a computer with a projector, or a simple flip chart. The moderator or the facilitator of the brainstorming session should restate the problem. Individuals should be able to shout out possible solutions. The facilitator writes them down or types them into the computer, which is then projected so that all people can see the proposals. The most critical point of the brainstorming session is the openness with which the group accepts any and all ideas. No matter how bizarre or off-the-wall a suggestion might appear to be, no one is allowed to criticize it. Even if an idea is simply crazy, participants do not have the latitude to make any negative remarks. After all the ideas have been presented and written down, the group begins a process of winnowing down the number of suggestions to a smaller number, perhaps five.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_037">Jeffrey P. Baumgartner, “The Step by-Step Guide to Brainstorming,” <em class="emphasis">The Wonderful World of Jeffery Paul Baumgartner</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://jpb.com/creative/brainstorming.php">jpb.com/creative/brainstorming.php</a>.</span> In the real world, most decisions cannot be done with respect to a simple, single criterion. As an example, one might evaluate the five possible solutions with respect to cost. In the freewheeling environment of brainstorming, one possible solution might yield the lowest cost but might be illegal. Before evaluating the reduced set of solutions, the group must identify all the criteria that would be useful in determining the solutions. Examples of such criteria might be cost, viability, the probability of implementing the solution within a given timeline, or customer acceptance. Once these criteria have been identified, the group can then scale (numerically evaluate) each solution with respect to the criteria. Such an approach should help the group identify the overall best solution. This is the most basic and most common format for brainstorming. Other variations exist that are designed to deal with some possible deficiencies of classical brainstorming, such as naturally reticent members.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_038">“Brainstorming: Generating Many Radical, Creative Ideas,” <em class="emphasis">Mind Tools</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindtools.com/brainstm.html">www.mindtools.com/brainstm.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s02_p06">Another useful approach to stimulate creative thinking about a problem or an issue is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">mind mapping</a><span class="glossdef">A diagram that specifies all the types of relationships among key elements of a problem or an issue.</span></span>. This technique is used widely in a variety of contexts, including creative writing courses. It is a visual model that uses words, phrases, tasks, or concepts centered on an idea or a problem. A node or a figure representing the core notion is drawn at the center. Ideas that are related to this central notion are drawn off, as branches, to the sides. These secondary ideas, in turn, may generate other offshoots. This continues until all interrelationships are mapped on the diagram. <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s02_f01">Figure 13.2 "Mind Map for Expanding Frank’s All-American BarBeQue"</a> is a mind map that might have been drawn for Frank’s All-American BarBeQue, when it was considering an expansion.</p>

        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s02_p07">William Simione Jr., the founding member of Simione Consultants (see the opening vignette of <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch09#cadden_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Accounting and Cash Flow"</a>), has always believed that there has been a need for the home health and hospice industries to have timely financial benchmarks. Recognizing that this need was not being met, Simione started Financial Monitor LLC in 2009. This company launched a product known as the <em class="emphasis">Financial Monitor</em>. This is an excellent example of a business using its creativity to develop a new business. Using the company’s expertise in the home health and hospice industries, Simione designed a program that would benchmark clients’ quarterly financial reports against industry standards. Two principals, William Simione III and David Berman, have managed the development of the <em class="emphasis">Financial Monitor</em>. In 2009, Rob Simione was added to the <em class="emphasis">Financial Monitor</em> team as the senior manager.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s02_p08">The long-term goal of the <em class="emphasis">Financial Monitor</em> is to become the industry’s major database for financial information. Currently, Simione has a database of 160 providers. With this information, Simione not only provides clients with meaningful financial information but also provides the home health and hospice industry with data that can be used in advocacy efforts on both national and state levels. Simione has begun to work with both the National Association for Home Care and Hospice and several state associations to have the <em class="emphasis">Financial Monitor</em> help them in their advocacy efforts. The short-term goal is to have five hundred home health and hospice agencies on the <em class="emphasis">Financial Monitor</em> by end of 2011, and the long-range goal is to have in excess of five thousand on it by the end of 2014.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_p01">When considering effectiveness or efficiency improvements on an organizational level, one generally thinks in terms of programs: projects with some battery of tools and techniques. Quite often, the businessperson is confronted with choosing from a cornucopia of the most recent business fads. The fad de jour is tried and often found wanting. Eventually, businesspeople become inured to the latest hot trend, continue with their standard operations, and become less willing to try something new. This is extremely unfortunate because some of these programs offer the opportunity for significant improvements. Two such programs are quality management and lean thinking. Both approaches grew out of manufacturing environments. Most of the articles and books about them tend to emphasize manufacturing-based examples. However, this does not mean that they are limited to that domain. More and more service industries are recognizing that the adoption of quality management and/or lean thinking offers tremendous benefits in effectiveness and efficiency. The same can also be said about the acceptance of these business models by smaller firms. Although some quality and lean programs are presented as complete and complex systems requiring extensive training routines, many small businesses have adopted the underlying concepts without resorting to significant expenditures. They recognized that the promulgation of the underlying principles of quality and lean management can yield significant returns without significant expenditures.</p>

Intimately linked to customer value is the notion of quality. Therefore, it is extremely unfortunate that for most people, businesspeople included, the term <em class="emphasis">quality</em> is either totally misunderstood or viewed from a rather narrow perspective. This stems from two reasons. The first is based on a correct assumption that quality is defined by the user (customer); however, many then go on to believe that because quality is subjective, it then becomes impossible to define. The second problem centers on the tendency to view quality, particularly in products, as singularly the result of the use of costly raw materials, components, careful craftsmanship, and detailed processes. It is assumed that together these expensive elements must necessarily produce a quality but costly outcome. In this belief system, if one wants to identify the quality of the product, one has to look only at the price tag. Quality is synonymous with cost. This is a huge error because, as will be shown, a true commitment to quality can reduce costs and expenses—and do so quite significantly.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p06">Without a fundamental understanding of what quality really means, it is impossible to achieve it—consistently. So how should one approach a useful definition of the term <em class="emphasis">quality</em>? Many authors suggest that when discussing quality, it is useful to distinguish between product quality and service quality. Today, there may be no clear-cut distinction between exclusively product-based businesses or exclusively service-based businesses. Few products can be viewed in isolation from supporting services. As an example, an automobile manufacturer clearly produces a product; however, few manufacturers would survive long if they totally excluded the area of follow-up services, such as vehicle maintenance across a car’s lifetime. Likewise, many service businesses rely on ancillary products. An investment company provides a service; however, it may also provide its clients with investment perspective reports. Many view McDonald’s as essentially a service company—the service being the delivery of fast food; obviously, the ancillary product is the food.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p07">The literature indicates that rather than having a unitary definition of quality, it is important to identify the dimensions of quality. In a seminal 1984 article, David Garvin identified eight dimensions of product quality: <strong class="emphasis bold">performance</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">features</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">reliability</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">conformance</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">durability</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">serviceability</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">aesthetics</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">perceived quality</strong>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_042">David Garvin, “What Does ‘Product Quality’ Really Mean?,” <em class="emphasis">Sloan Management Review</em> 26, no. 1 (1984): 25–43.</span> <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_t01">Table 13.1 "The Eight Dimensions of Product Quality"</a> describes what these dimensions mean and gives examples. Garvin recognized that no consumer will find all eight dimensions equally important. However, to ensure success, a business must identify which of the eight dimensions are important to its customers. As an example, if we are dealing with a product such as a heart pacemaker, customers would be most interested in the reliability and durability dimensions of that product. If a customer is buying a car for street drag racing only, then that person’s focus would be on the performance dimensions of the vehicle.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p08">Another approach to examining quality, this time in the service context, is to explicitly consider quality as a comparison between a customer’s expectations and a customer’s perception of performance. Parasuraman, Zeithaml, and Berry argued in their 1985 seminal article that there were ten determinants (dimensions) of service quality: reliability, responsiveness, competence, access, courtesy, communication, credibility, security, knowing the customer, and tangibles.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_043">A. Parasuraman, Valerie A. Zeithaml, and Leonard L. Berry, “A Conceptual Model of Service Quality and Its Implications for Future Research,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Marketing</em> 49 (1985): 41.</span> After some major research, they reduced this set to five dimensions: <strong class="emphasis bold">tangibles</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">reliability</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">responsiveness</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">assurance</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">empathy</strong>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_044">Valerie A. Zeithaml, A. Parasuraman, and Leonard L. Berry, <em class="emphasis">Delivering Quality Service: Balancing Customer Perceptions and Expectations</em> (New York: Free Press, 1990), 38.</span> Again, it is critical to note that customers will not view all five dimensions as equally important. In fact, the relative rank of these dimensions may differ significantly across industries. The approach of Zeithaml et al. has become well known as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">SERVQUAL</a><span class="glossdef">A market research instrument that plays a prominent role in improving quality in service environments.</span></span> instrument, and it plays a prominent role in improving quality in service environments. The five service quality dimensions are given in <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_t02">Table 13.2 "The Dimensions of Service Quality"</a>. This SERVQUAL system explains the notion that quality is associated with a gap between expectations and perceptions. It identifies the following five types of gaps that a service organization should examine and attempt to minimize:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>The gap between what customers expect and what a business believes are its customers’ expectations</li>
            <li>The gap between a business’s evaluation of its own performance and how its customers evaluate its performance</li>
            <li>The gap between a customer’s experience and a business’s specified level of performance</li>
            <li>The gap between the communicated level of service by a business and what a customer actually experiences</li>
            <li>The gap between a customer’s expectation and actual experience.</li>
        </ol>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p09">From looking at these five gaps, it should be obvious that a full utilization of the SERVQUAL instrument is quite a challenge and might be beyond the capacity of most small businesses. That does not mean, however, that a business interested in providing its customers with quality service cannot apply some of the elements of the SERVQUAL instrument or use it as a conceptual template.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p10">When using the term <em class="emphasis">quality management</em>, we should recognize that there is no universally consistent notion of how one can produce quality products and services. In fact, the quality management movement has been evolving for nearly a century. Perhaps the best way of tracing this evolution is to examine the contributions of some of the key proponents of quality. One of the first bodies of work that should be reviewed is that of Walter A. Shewhart (1891–1967). Similar to two other “quality gurus”—W. Edwards Deming and Joseph Juran (the authors are hesitant to use the term <em class="emphasis">guru</em> because this might question the true value of the work of these individuals)—Shewhart worked for Western Electric Company, a division of AT&amp;T.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_045">“Walter A. Shewhart,” <em class="emphasis">ASQ</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://asq.org/about-asq/who-we-are/bio_shewhart.html">asq.org/about-asq/who -we-are/bio_shewhart.html</a>.</span> There he developed what is now known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">statistical process control (SPC)</a><span class="glossdef">A mathematical approach that measures how well products conform to previously determined standards.</span></span>, a mathematical approach that measures how well products conform to previously determined standards. The goal here is to develop a control chart that would enable an operator to distinguish between the random change associated with any manufacturing process and specifically assignable causes of such change. As an example, a machine produces 0.25-inch diameter bolts. Not all the manufactured bolts will be exactly 0.25 inches in diameter. There will be some natural variation around this value. Rather than test the diameter of every bolt, in SPC, a sample of bolts is tested on a regular basis. Based on statistical analysis, one can determine if this sample is within acceptable limits around the 0.25-inch value. If a sample is not within these acceptable limits, then the machine is shut down, and every effort is made to determine the assignable cause—faulty materials, machine error, or operator error. The benefit of this approach is that one can determine, with a high degree of accuracy, the operational characteristics of the system without the expense of testing every item produced. A full discussion of all aspects of SPC is beyond the focus of this text.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p11">Shewhart’s two books, <em class="emphasis">Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product</em><span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_046">Walter A. Shewhart, <em class="emphasis">Economic Control of Quality of Manufactured Product</em> (New York: D.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p12">Shewhart also made major contributions in the way we think about implementing a quality program in any organization. He advocated a systematic approach structured in four cyclical phases. This approach is sometimes referred to as the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">PDCA cycle</a><span class="glossdef">A series of steps to ensure continuous improvement.</span></span> (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_f01">Figure 13.3 "The PDCA Cycle"</a>) or the Deming cycle. (Yet the Deming cycle is an improper name for the PDCA cycle.) The PDCA cycle calls for a cycle of continuous improvement. The first step is to <em class="emphasis">plan</em> for a change that would lead to improvement. The planning process requires data collection to make a decision. Regardless of the approach to quality management, all decision making must be data driven. The second step in the cycle is the <em class="emphasis">do</em> phase. This entails implementing the change. It also implies that a business will implement that change on an experimental basis, meaning that the organization would run a pilot program rather than implementing it throughout the entire organization. The third phase of the cycle is <em class="emphasis">check</em>. This means that after a sufficient period of time following the initial implementation phase, the results are evaluated to ascertain if the change produced the desired effect. If that answer is positive, then the organization moves onto the fourth stage of the cycle (<em class="emphasis">act</em>), where the changes are implemented throughout the entire organization. At the end of the <em class="emphasis">act</em> phase, the process is repeated with respect to some new problem area.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p17">The last quality theorist who should be discussed is Philip Crosby. Crosby was an executive at ITT and the Martin Company. His approach to quality reflected a practicing manager’s perspective. Although he is often associated (correctly) with the zero-defect program, his great contribution can be found in his first book <em class="emphasis">Quality Is Free</em>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_051">Philip Crosby, <em class="emphasis">Quality Is Free</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1979).</span> In this text, Crosby argued that the definition of quality should be based on conformance to quality, and nonconformance is highly expensive. He estimates that the cost of nonconformance can run as high as 30 percent of revenue.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_052">Philip B. Crosby, “Quality Is Free—If You Understand It,” <em class="emphasis">Philip Crosby Associates II Inc.</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wppl.org/wphistory/philipcrosby/QualityIsFreeIfYouUnderstandIt.pdf">www.wppl.org/wphistory/philipcrosby/QualityIsFreeIfYouUnderstandIt.pdf</a>.</span> This figure includes costs associated with rework, scrap, warranties, lost goodwill, reputation, and customers. He further argues that expenditures on quality to guarantee conformance to requirements will always be less than the cost of nonconformance; therefore, quality should be seen as being free. Crosby was embraced by many American executives because of his emphasis on the practical and his formal acknowledgment of the importance of the bottom line. His approach is often referred to as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Total Quality Management</a><span class="glossdef">A catchall term that covers a variety of methods and approaches to improve organizational quality.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p18">Implementing quality management concepts in American business has had a long and somewhat checkered history. In the last four decades, total quality and continuous quality movements have blossomed in popularity and then quickly died. Two decades ago, Walter Lareau argued that many American businesses, particularly large businesses, have an almost pathological antipathy toward quality management because some of its (quality) fundamental principles run totally counter to corporate belief systems, namely, customers are a pain and employees are an even bigger pain.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_053">Walter Lareau, <em class="emphasis">American Samurai: Why Every American Executive Must Fight for Quality</em> (New York: Warner Books, 1991), 47.</span> In the intervening time, however, it appears that one approach to quality has captured the imagination of many businesses—both large and small. This quality program is known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Six Sigma</a><span class="glossdef">A quality management program created by the Motorola Corporation that seeks to reduce defects to the Six Sigma level, which translates as no more than 3.4 defects per million parts.</span></span>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p19">Although Six Sigma is often associated, at least in the public’s mind, with General Electric, it began at Motorola in the 1980s and was spearheaded by William Smith.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_054">Wolf Akpose, “A History of Six Sigma,” December 2010, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.todaysengineer.org/2010/Dec/six-sigma.asp">www.todaysengineer.org/2010/Dec/six-sigma.asp</a>.</span> The term <em class="emphasis">sigma</em> (σ) comes from SPC and represents the concept of the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">standard deviation</a><span class="glossdef">A statistical measure of dispersal about the mean. It is used in SPC models.</span></span>. Six standard deviations away from specifications signify that the process produces only 3.4 defects per million opportunities. This is a remarkable accomplishment. Imagine a restaurant that is open 12 hours a day, 365 days per year. On average, the restaurant serves 1 meal every 55 seconds or about 800 meals per day. It would take them approximately 3.4 years to serve one million meals. So if this restaurant was operating at a Six Sigma level, it would make a mistake in taking an order <em class="emphasis">only once a year</em>. Six Sigma draws on a battery of tools and techniques derived from SPC and earlier quality management programs. Six Sigma’s mantra for continuous improvement involves what is referred to as the <em class="emphasis">DMAIC</em> cycle (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_f02">Figure 13.4 "The DMAIC Cycle"</a>), where D stands for design, M stands for measurement, A stands for analyze, I stands for improve, and C stands for control. Clearly, this concept is derived from the Shewhart cycle.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s03_s01_p20">What was different about the Six Sigma program was that all these tools and techniques were packaged in a coherent program. There was a heavy emphasis on quick results and the ability to demonstrate to management tangible cost savings. Six Sigma involves committed training programs that promote statistical tools and management techniques. Graduates of the most basic certification training program are referred to as “green belts,” a term derived from the martial arts. Those who receive more advanced training are known as “black belts.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_055">“Six Sigma Training, History, Definitions: Six Sigma and Quality Management Glossary,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessBalls.com</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessballs.com/sixsigma.htm">www.businessballs.com/sixsigma.htm</a>.</span> Given that Six Sigma is closely associated with large corporate entities and complex training programs, one might think that it would be irrelevant for smaller enterprises. Nothing could be further from the truth. Six Sigma offers a systematic and pragmatic approach for quality improvement in the smaller firm.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_056">Greg Brue, “Six Sigma for Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur Press</em>, 2006, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/downloads/assist/six_sigma_for_smallbusiness.pdf">www.entrepreneur.com/downloads/assist/six_sigma_for_smallbusiness.pdf</a>.</span></p>

This concept was first introduced to American businesspeople in the book <em class="emphasis">The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production—Toyota’s Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now Revolutionizing World Industry</em>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_059">James P.

It highlighted the significant differences in productivity between Japanese firms, Toyota in particular, and their American and European rivals. At the time the book was written, Toyota was half the size of General Motors; today, on a global basis, Toyota is larger than General Motors. The book highlighted the approach adopted by Toyota, which is, as articulated by Taiichi Ohno, its developer, centered on “the absolute elimination of waste.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p04">Although lean is most closely associated with Toyota, its central principles are applicable for any small and midsize enterprise. Audubon Media Corporation is a publisher of cookbooks. It adopted a program that included a variety of lean techniques. In a two-year period, it increased sales by 25 percent without increasing staffing, reduced lead time by at least 50 percent, and increased available floor space by 20 percent through inventory reduction and more efficient redesign. Corporate Image, a manufacturer of packaging, adopted lean methods and reduced lead times by over 35 percent and reduced costs by nearly $180,000 in one year.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_060">Jim Black, “Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) for Small- and Medium-Sized Companies,” <em class="emphasis">CIRAS News</em> 33, no. 2 (1999), accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ciras.iastate.edu/publications/management/Kaizen.asp">www.ciras.iastate.edu/publications/management/Kaizen.asp</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p05">Lean thinking is predicated on five major principles.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_061">“The Five Principles of Lean Thinking,” <em class="emphasis">Cardiff University</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/lean/principles/index.html">www.cardiff.ac.uk/lean/principles/index.html</a>.</span> The first principle can be summarized as follows: <em class="emphasis">know who your customers are and know how they define value</em>. This principle coincides nicely with the underlying philosophy of the quality movement, namely, placing the customer first. Without understanding what the customer wants and what the customer values, an organization runs the risk of producing a wasteful quantity of goods and services that the customer does not want or need.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p06">The second principle of lean thinking centers on <em class="emphasis">determining and visualizing the value stream</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value stream</a><span class="glossdef">The entire set of activities associated with the production of goods and services.</span></span> is the entire set of activities associated with the production of goods and services. The goal of such mapping is to identify any and all activities that provide no value to the customer. Once those nonvalue activities have been identified, they are to be eliminated. Students are required, every semester, to go to their advisor and begin the process to register for the next semester or prepare for graduation. Imagine mapping out every step in that process. Having done that, colleges and universities could probably find some steps or activities that do not add value. In a lean operation, those steps would be eliminated. One could also think in terms of the process that most patients face when going to some type of medical facility. They are often required to fill out multiple forms that require the same information. In <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_f01">Figure 13.5 "Value Stream Map for Supplying Hospitals with Blood"</a>, we provide an example of a value stream map for the process of supplying hospitals with blood.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p07">The third principle of lean thinking argues that every effort should be made to <em class="emphasis">make the remaining steps flow</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">flow</em> here refers to the notion that from design to delivery to the customer, all steps and activities should be structured in such a way that there will be minimal or nonexistent downtime, waste, or waiting within or between the steps.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_062">“The Principles of Lean Thinking: Tools and Techniques for Advanced Manufacturing,” <em class="emphasis">Industial Technology Centre</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.itc.mb.ca/downloads/resources_by_topic/princ_lean%20thinking/PrinciplesofLeanThinkingRevD2004.pdf">www.itc.mb.ca/downloads/resources_by_topic/princ_lean%20thinking/PrinciplesofLeanThinkingRevD2004.pdf</a>.</span> This is perhaps the most challenging of all the five principles of lean thinking. To make operations flow in a seamless manner often requires substantive changes in production and service processes. In fact, it may require substantive changes to the structure of a business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p08">The fourth principle involves a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pull system</a><span class="glossdef">The production of the goods and services are triggered by customer demand.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">triggered by customer needs</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">pull</em> means that the production of goods and services is triggered by customer demand. This aspect of lean is what is commonly referred to as just-in-time inventory. The central idea is that the entire value stream is fired up only by customer demand. Thus inventory throughout the system is minimized.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p09">The fifth and last principle is <em class="emphasis">pursuing perfection</em>. This clearly shows that lean thinking is not totally separate and divorced from the concepts of total quality management or Six Sigma. This last principle advocates that removing the impediments to quality will mean a significant reduction in waste. Like Crosby’s work, lean advocates often talk of striving for zero defects.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p10">One of the first steps in any lean program is identifying where waste exists within the system. Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo, the two cofounders of the Toyota Production System, identified seven possible sources of waste: <strong class="emphasis bold">transportation</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">inventory</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">motion</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">waiting</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">overprocessing</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">overproduction</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">defects</strong>. (A nice mnemonic to remember these seven sources is TIM WOOD.) <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_t01">Table 13.4 "Seven Sources of Manufacturing Wastes"</a> identifies and gives examples of the original seven sources of waste used throughout Toyota.</p>

Simplicity accomplishes the task, minimizes the chance for failure, and reduces waste. A classic example of this would be the engineers who were asked to determine the volume of a complex part. Some began by taking accurate measurements to compute the volume of some segments of the part.

Overproduction is seen by some as the driving force behind the other six sources of waste. Lean thinking tasks them to reexamine these basic assumptions.</td>
                    <td>A manufacturer has a good idea of the annual demand of a particular part. Setting up the machine that is used to produce this part is an expense proposition. Financial analysis indicates that the company should produce one batch of the part every quarter (three months’ worth of supply). A three-month supply of the part means that a considerable portion sits in inventory for a long period of time. This quantity of inventory may also mask any defects in manufacturing. It would take quite a while to go through this batch before one would realize that the batch might have had problems in production. A company that focused on reducing the setup cost of the machine could then produce smaller batches, which, in turn, would produce lower inventory levels and therefore catch quality problems earlier.</td>

It recognizes that lean by itself cannot bring processes under control, and Six Sigma significantly reduces process time or capital investment.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_066">Michael George, <em class="emphasis">Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed and Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003), 6.</span> Both approaches offer benefits to small businesses that cannot be ignored if these businesses want to remain viable in an increasingly competitive world.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_p01">As a business grows, it will—in all probability—increase the number of its employees. As the employee base grows, there is increased demand to coordinate activities, exchange information, and engage in decision-making activities. These usually occur at meetings, and one would think that these would be straightforward events. Yet the reality is that many managers and employees come to dread participation at meetings. Data indicate that many, if not most, meetings fail to produce the desired outcome. A study conducted in 1993 found that executives were seen as a spending seventeen hours per week in meetings, and one-third felt that time was wasted.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_069">Roy Woodard, “Meetings, Bloody Meetings,” <em class="emphasis">Credit Control</em> 15, no. 5 (1993): 1.</span> Another survey of thirty-eight thousand managers found that 66 percent felt that the meetings they attend were a waste of time.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_070">Robert F. Moran Jr., “Meetings: The Bane of the Workplace, It Doesn’t Have to Be,” <em class="emphasis">Library Administration &amp; Management</em> 20, no. 3 (2006): 135–39, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://journals.tdl.org/llm/article/view/1637/917">journals.tdl.org/llm/article/view/1637/917</a>.</span> Still another study found that managers spend as much as 40 percent of their work time in meetings, but only 64 percent of those meetings were seen as achieving their intended outcome;<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_071">Judith Lindenberger, “Make the Most of Your Meetings,” <em class="emphasis">Office Solutions</em> 24, no. 3 (2007): 40.</span> another study found that executives were spending as much as 70 percent of their time at meetings, but only 40 percent of those meetings had clear objectives, and only 28 percent of those meetings with objectives actually met them.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_072">Stuart Levine, “Make Meetings Less Ready,” <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em> 52, no. 1 (2007): 107.</span> Yet 80 percent of the participants viewed running a successful meeting as a crucial test of manager’s abilities.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_073">Stuart Levine, “Make Meetings Less Ready,” <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em> 52, no. 1 (2007): 107.</span> These figures are particularly tragic because so many meetings occur in the business world. One estimate puts the number of meetings, on a daily basis, globally, at 73 million.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_074">Charlie Hawkins, “‘F’ Words for Effective Meetings,” <em class="emphasis">Journal for Quality and Participation</em> 22, no. 5 (1999): 56.</span> These are rather depressing figures, but the clear lesson for small business owners is that they cannot afford the luxury of not running their meetings effectively.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_p02">The good news is that the successful management of a meeting is a learnable skill.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_075">Roy Woodard, “Meetings, Bloody Meetings,” <em class="emphasis">Credit Control</em> 14, no. 5 (1993): 1.</span> Conducting an effective meeting requires that a manager focus on both procedural and behavioral issues. We will first look at procedural issues associated with running a meeting. Before considering holding a meeting, ask the following question: “Is this meeting really necessary?” Frequent meetings are sometimes held merely out of habit.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_076">Kelley Robertson, “How to Run an Effective Sales Meeting,” <em class="emphasis">Changing Minds</em>, June 7, 2009, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://changingminds.org/articles/articles09/effective_sales_metting.htm">changingminds.org/articles/articles09/effective_sales_metting.htm</a>.</span> Can the goals of a meeting be achieved by other mechanisms?<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_077">Stuart Levine, “Make Meetings Less Ready,” <em class="emphasis">HR Magazine</em> 52, no. 1 (2007): 107.</span> These might include using the Internet; e-mail; teleconferencing; or technologies, such as MS Communicator, which allows for bulletin board interaction, voice communication, and videoconferencing. Interestingly, for all the complaints about meetings, a recent study indicated that face-to-face meetings were seen by 95 percent of those surveyed as being positive, especially in the interest of developing long-term relationships.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_078">Jay Boehmer, “Harvard Study Shows Face-to-Face Meeting Value, Rising Virtual Interest,” <em class="emphasis">Successful Meetings</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.successfulmeetings.com/Event-Planning/Technology-Solutions/Articles/Harvard-Study-Shows-Face-To-Face-Meeting-Value,-Rising-Virtual-Interest">www.successfulmeetings.com/Event-Planning/Technology-Solutions/Articles/Harvard-Study-Shows-Face-To-Face-Meeting-Value,-Rising-Virtual-Interest</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_p03">After deciding that a meeting is necessary, it is important to determine the nature of that meeting. Meetings may have many different types of goals. They can be directed to problem solving, decision making, conflict resolution, providing information, or generating new ideas.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_079">T. L. Stanley, “Make Your Meetings Effective,” <em class="emphasis">SuperVision</em> 67, no. 4 (2005): 6; Curt Smith, “Effective Meetings—Not an Oxymoron!” <em class="emphasis">Manage</em> 51, no. 1 (1999): 10.</span> This is necessary because the nature of the meeting will drive its structure and internal dynamics. As an example, if a meeting is directed to a decision-making task, it should probably proceed in two parts. The first portion should be directed toward identifying solutions, while the second portion should focus on what might be the best solution.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_080">Robert F. Moran Jr., “Meetings: The Bane of the Workplace, It Doesn’t Have to Be,” <em class="emphasis">Library Administration &amp; Management</em> 20, no. 3 (2006): 135–39, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://journals.tdl.org/llm/article/view/1637/917">journals.tdl.org/llm/article/view/1637/917</a>.</span> The next decision would be to determine who will participate in the meeting. Ideally, this list would be limited to those who would be directly affected by the outcome of the meeting; however, in the case of informational meetings, the list may be expanded to those who will be directly or indirectly affected. The next decision is associated with determining who will be assigned particular roles in the meeting. The chair is the individual who calls the meeting, provides the initial agenda, and specifies the purpose of the meeting. It may be useful to assign the role of facilitator to an individual. This neutral person can push the meeting along, particularly when conflict arises. It is desirable to have people trained as facilitators and rotate this position among facilitators.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_081">Charlie Hawkins, “‘F’ Words for Effective Meetings,” <em class="emphasis">Journal for Quality and Participation</em> 22, no. 5 (1999): 56.</span> Another important role is the individual who is officially assigned to take notes. The notes of the meeting should be written up and sent to all participants in the meeting within two business days. This position should also be rotated among the participants of the meeting. It also might be advisable to assign the role of timekeeper to an individual. The timekeeper has the task of limiting the amount of time spent on anyone agenda item to the previously agreed-on time frame.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_082">Wayne Chaneski, “Productive Meetings—Back to Basics,” <em class="emphasis">Modern Machine Shop</em> 79, no. 11 (2007): 52, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mmsonline.com/columns/productive-meetingsback-to-basics">www.mmsonline.com/columns/productive-meetingsback-to-basics</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s05_s01_p04">Perhaps the most important activity prior to the actual meeting is the proper structuring of an <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">agenda</a><span class="glossdef">A document the outlines the purpose, membership, and required resources for an upcoming meeting.</span></span>.

The roles of chair, timekeeper, note taker, and facilitator (where possible) should be assigned in advance. The agenda should be sent out at least five business days before the meeting so that participants can gather the required information. This timeline also allows for people to make suggestions for changing the agenda. It is also highly advisable to make it a policy that all participants arrive on time at the beginning of the meeting.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_087">Max Messner, “Conducting Effective Meetings,” <em class="emphasis">Strategic Finance</em> 82, no. 12 (2001): 8, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6421/is_12_82/ai_n28842307">findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb6421/is_12_82/ai_n28842307</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Value Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p01">It should be clear that quality management and lean thinking have the notion of customer value at their cores. Both approaches actively incorporate needs and wants into the design of products and services and, even more importantly, into the design of the processes used to create these products and services. Regardless of what quality program one adopts for an organization, the issue of customer value is the single most important question. Lean thinking also recognizes the vital importance of first identifying the customer’s notion of value so that any activity that does not add value is ruthlessly eliminated. As one article put it, “Lean enterprise never misses an opportunity to capture information about customers.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_092">Christer Karlsson and Pär Ahlstrom, “A Lean and Smaller Global Firm?,” <em class="emphasis">International Journal of Operations and Production Management</em> 17, no. 10 (1997): 940.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p02">The linkages between quality management, lean thinking, and customer value, therefore, should be obvious. What is less obvious is the connection between customer value and topics such as creativity, time management, and running meetings effectively. Nonetheless, indirect connections do exist. Without creativity, there will not be any new product development, and there will be no innovations in design, packaging, promotion, or distribution that can be so vital to the enhancement of value.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s01_p03">Owners, managers, supervisors, and employees who cannot manage their time effectively or efficiently will be unable to provide appropriate attention to improving customer value. Poorly run meetings are inefficient and degrade morale; neither is a recipe for enhancing customer value.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash-Flow Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p01">The old saying “time is money” may be shopworn, but it is an absolute truism. Wasting time inexorably turns into a waste of money. Poor time management means that time is wasted, which costs the individual and the organization.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p02">In a depressed economy, both large and small firms attempt to preserve cash flow by adopting a program of cost cutting. This often begins with laying off employees. However, this presents a rather significant problem. As Nancy Koehn, a business historian at Harvard business School, points out, “If demand picks up, you can’t exploit it because you don’t have the resources.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_093">Sarah E. Needleman, “Three Best Ways to Get Lean,” <em class="emphasis">Wall Street Journal</em>, March 25, 2000, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094104575143680597058528.html">online.wsj.com/article/SB10001424052748704094104575143680597058528.html</a>.</span> Lean thinking offers an alternative to cost cutting by reducing staff. Lean thinking, a focus on more intelligent cost-cutting, and the efficient use of all business resources have produced significant results, such as an 80 percent to a 90 percent reduction in inventory investment, an 80 percent to a 90 percent reduction in manufacturing lead times, a 50 percent reduction in space requirements, and a 50 percent reduction in material handling equipment. Such results translate into tremendous cost savings.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_094">Lawrence P. Etkin, Farhard M. E. Raiszadeh, and Harold R. Hunt Jr., “Just-in-Time: A Timely Opportunity for Small Manufacturers,” <em class="emphasis">Industrial Management</em> 32, no. 1 (1990): 16.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p03">Firms that have used the principles of the Toyota Production System have also found that they can achieve a 50 percent reduction in human effort and a 200 percent to a 500 percent improvement in quality. One small manufacturer, Gelman Sciences, adopted a lean approach to operations, and during a nine-month period, one section of the company saw inventory turns go from twenty to fifty-seven, inventory value dropped from $86,000 to $33,000, and lead time dropped from three to four weeks to one to three days.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_095">Matthew Zayko, Douglas Broughman, and Walter Hancock, “Lean Manufacturing Yields World-Class Improvements for Small Manufacturing,” <em class="emphasis">IIE Solutions</em> 29, no. 4 (1997): 36.</span> Estee Bedding Company applied lean concepts to its operations and reduced its labor cost as a percentage of sales by one-half; Ameripay, a payroll service firm, saw sales increase from $1.8 million to $6 million in three years.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_096">John T. Slania, “Lean Firms Look to Ride Recovery,” <em class="emphasis">Crain’s Chicago Business</em> 27, no. 2 (2004): SB6.</span> Some small businesses that are part of a larger supply change may find their movement toward lean thinking supported by firms that are further up the supply chain. In the 1990s, Pratt &amp; Whitney initiated a program to assist smaller firms in its supply chain by requiring them to move to more of a lean focus.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_097">Mario Emiliani, “Supporting Small Businesses in Their Transition to Lean Production,” <em class="emphasis">Supply Chain Management</em> 5, no. 2 (2000): 66–71.</span> Even small foreign firms are beginning to recognize the economic benefits from adopting lean methodologies. A polyvinyl chloride manufacturer in Thailand adopted a lean management program and saw its average production time per unit decline from forty-four minutes to twenty-three minutes while decreasing the number of operators from fifty to forty-one.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_098">Nanchanok Wongsamuth, “Nawaplastic Pushes Lean Management,” <em class="emphasis">McClatchy Tribune Business News</em>, July 31, 2010.</span> The concepts behind lean thinking, with its focus on efficiencies, should dictate that a small business should automate as many processes—such as bookkeeping—as possible and rely on outsourcing when feasible.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_099">Matt Dotson and Brandon Kennington, “Eliminating Waste Using Lean Concepts for Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">Automate My Small Business</em>, November 9, 2009, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://automatemysmallbusiness.com/eliminating-waste-using-lean-concepts-for-small-business">automatemysmallbusiness.com/eliminating-waste-using-lean-concepts-for -small-business</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p04">One does not have to commit to major organizational programs, such as a quality management system or lean thinking, to find ways to save on cash flow. Earlier in this chapter we cited two studies. One said that better than one-third of executives believed that all meetings were a waste, while the second study said that two-thirds of all meetings were a waste. We split the difference between these two studies and arrive at a figure that one-half of all meetings are perceived as useless. This can have significant cash-flow implications, even for small firms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s02_p05">Let us illustrate this through a simple example. The owner of a small hardware store believes it is important to have weekly meetings with the store’s supervisor and five employees. Let us assume that the owner values his or her time at $70 per hour. The supervisor’s value is given at $35 an hour, while each employee’s time is valued at $10 per hour. Employees are expected to produce 2.5 times their pay. This means that a 1-hour meeting should be valued at $282.50 [$70/hour + 2.5 × (5 employees × $10/hour) + 2.5 × (1 supervisor × $35/hour)]. Assuming 52 meetings per year, the total opportunity cost for these meetings is $14,690. If one-half of those meetings are a waste, then the business is losing nearly $7,350 a year. There are many areas throughout a firm’s operations that can be evaluated to reduce wasteful activities and improve its cash-flow position.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s03_p01">Time-management systems are available in a variety of paper-and-pencil and software formats. They generally allow for listing to-do tasks, setting due dates, identifying required resources, and prioritizing their importance. Some allow for a project format, where one can break down the project into smaller interrelated tasks. Many of them provide the capability to synchronize this information across several computers and smartphones. This would allow a person to have the time-management system available on an office computer, a home computer, and in the pocket (smartphone). One system is based on Covey’s fourth-generation approach to time management.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s03_p02">Multiple software packages are geared to assist individuals and groups who wish to improve their creativity. There are packages to help with brainstorming in its various forms. Numerous companies provide mind-mapping software in a variety of formats: computers, iPads, and even smartphones.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s06_s03_p03">Quality management encompasses many tools and techniques, far more than could ever be covered in this chapter. There are packages geared just for statistical process control (SPC) models. Some can receive data from a process and then automatically inform the operator of a “drift” from conformance to standards. In addition to SPC models, other packages include tools that are used to improve quality. These packages range from less than $100 to many thousands of dollars.</p>
