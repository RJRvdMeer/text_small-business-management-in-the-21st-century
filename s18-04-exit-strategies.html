The strategy should be developed early in the business, and it should be reviewed and changed periodically because conditions change. Unfortunately, many small business owners have no exit strategy. This will make an already very emotional decision and process even more difficult.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s04_p02">There are many exit strategies that a small business owner can consider. Liquidation or walk away, family succession, selling the business, bankruptcy, and taking the company public are discussed here.

The owner must first decide what he or she wants to walk away with—for example, money, management control, or intellectual property. If interested only in money, selling the business on the open market or to another business may be the best choice. If, on the other hand, one’s legacy and seeing the small business continue are important, family succession or selling the business to the employees might be a better solution.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_058">Susan Ward, “Exit Strategies for Your Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed June 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/businessplanning/a/exitstrategies.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/od/businessplanning/a/exitstrategies.htm</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s04_s03_p03">Chapter 11 small business bankruptcy allows an owner to run a business with court oversight. The owner loses control of the firm, but it continues to operate. The owner is protected from creditors in the short term because the court orders an automatic stay that prevents the creditors from seizing your assets. Unfortunately, the outcome is not pleasant.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Negotiate debt.</strong> This involves trying to reorganize a business’s finances outside a legal proceeding. The owner can work with the creditors to renegotiate the terms of payment and the amount owed to each creditor. If a business is basically profitable but the debt situation is due to an unusual circumstance, such as a lawsuit or a temporary industry slowdown, this could be a successful solution.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Improve operations.</strong> If the owner is in a position to fix the cash problem by fixing the underlying problems in the business, it may not be necessary to declare bankruptcy. An owner should look at cash-flow controls; eliminate unprofitable products, services, and divisions; and restructure into a leaner and meaner organization.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Turn around and restructure the business.</strong> This alternative combines debt negotiation and operational improvement—perhaps the best choice. By doing both things at the same time, an owner will be in an even stronger position to improve the balance sheet, cash flow, and profitability—and avoid insolvency.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s04_s06_p01">Another possible exit strategy is selling the business.

As in the case of SoBe (highlighted at the beginning of this chapter), the owners sold the business because, among other things, it was becoming something they did not want it to be—and it was no longer fun. Whatever the reason, an owner can sell a business only once, so be sure that it is the right exit strategy. The owner should address the following questions:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_092">Barbara Taylor, “How to Sell Your Business,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 7, 2010, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/business/smallbusiness/07guide.html">www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/business/smallbusiness/07guide.html</a>; Anthony Tjan, “The Founder’s Dilemma: To Sell or Not to Sell?,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, February 18, 2011, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/tjan/2011/02/the-founders-dilemma-to-sell-o.html">blogs.hbr.org/tjan/2011/02/the-founders-dilemma-to-sell-o.html</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Can the business be sold?</strong> There are many things that make a business attractive to buyers: a solid history of profitability, a large and loyal base of customers, a good reputation, a competitive advantage (e.g., intellectual property rights, patents, long-term contracts with clients, and exclusive distributorships), opportunities for growth, a desirable location, a skilled workforce, and a loyal workforce. If a business does not have at least some of these things or others of equal value, it will not likely generate much interest in the market.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Is the owner ready to sell or does the owner need to sell?</strong> Selling a business, when it is a choice, requires emotional and financial readiness. The owner must think about what life will be like after the business is sold. What will be a source of income? How will time be spent? Has the owner “sold out” or could more have been done with the business? Does the owner love what he or she is doing? Many small business owners suffer real remorse after handing their businesses over to a new owner. Selling the business because the owner is forced to will engender very different emotional and financial challenges.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What is the business worth?</strong> The owner may have no idea. For example, the owner of a small professional services firm felt the firm was worth more than $1 million. After a lengthy search, however, the owner received less than one-half that amount from the buyer. On the other side of the coin, the owner of an information technology (IT) company planned to sell the company to an employee for $200,000. However, after advertising the business for sale nationwide, the owner sold it for one dollar shy of $1 million.</li>

It is a good idea to hire an ESOP specialist. Keep in mind, though, that only corporations are eligible to form an ESOP.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s04_s06_s04_l01">
                    <li>The most emotional topic an owner will face when building a business—and the hardest decision he or she will probably have to make—is when and how to exit.</li>
                    <li>An exit strategy should be planned while running the business. Unfortunately, many small businesses do not have an exit plan.</li>
                    <li>There are many exit strategies that a small business owner can consider, including liquidation or walkaway, family succession, selling the business, bankruptcy, and taking a company public.</li>
                    <li>The best exit strategy is the one that best matches the small business and the owner’s personal and professional goals.</li>
                    <li>Liquidation is the selling of all assets. If all debts are paid, it can also be referred to as a walkaway. Walking away is the cleanest and best way to exit a business.</li>
                    <li>Family succession is the transference of leadership from one generation to the next to ensure continuity of family ownership in the business. It is a critical issue in family businesses because few family firms survive beyond the first generation and even fewer survive into the third generation.</li>
                    <li>The failure to plan for succession is seen as a basic human resource problem as well as the primary cause for the poor survival rate of family businesses.</li>
                    <li>Bankruptcy is an extreme exit strategy that uses a legal method for closing a business and paying off creditors when a business is failing and the debts are substantially greater than the assets.</li>
                    <li>Debt negotiations, operational improvements, or business turnaround and restructuring are alternatives to bankruptcy.</li>
                    <li>An IPO is a stock offering in which the owner or owners of equity in a business have their private holdings transferred into issues tradable in public markets, such as the NYSE.</li>
                    <li>There are several options for selling a business: acquisition, friendly buyout, selling to the employees, and selling in the open market.</li>
                    <li>An acquisition is when another business buys a business. In an acquisition, there is no limit on the perceived value of the business.</li>
                    <li>A friendly buyout is the transfer of ownership to family members, customers, employees, current managers, children, or friends—but it is still a sale.</li>
                    <li>Selling to the employees can be a win-win situation because they get an established business that they know a great deal about already, and the owner gets enthusiastic buyers who want to see a business continue to thrive.</li>
                    <li>Selling in the open market is the most popular exit strategy for small businesses.</li>
                    <li>It has been estimated that 75 percent of small businesses do not sell, so a business must market in a way that maximizes its value in the eyes of the potential buyer.</li>

Everyone loved the sauces, and there was definite interest in acquiring the sauce-making side of Frank’s business. It would fill a hole in their product line that they had been looking to fill.</p>
