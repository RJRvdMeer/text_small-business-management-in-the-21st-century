    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_p01">All small businesses need to be concerned about management principles. Management decisions will impact the success of a business, the health of its work environment, its growth if growth is an objective, and customer value and satisfaction. Seat-of-the-pants management may work temporarily, but its folly will inevitably take a toll on a business. This section discusses management principles, levels, and skills—all areas that small business owners should understand so that they can make informed and effective choices for their businesses.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Management?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p01">There is no universally accepted definition for management. The definitions run the gamut from very simple to very complex. For our purposes, we define <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">management</a><span class="glossdef">The application of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling functions in the most efficient manner possible to accomplish meaningful organizational objectives.</span></span> as “the application of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling functions in the most efficient manner possible to accomplish meaningful organizational objectives.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_001">John M. Ivancevich and Thomas N. Duening, <em class="emphasis">Business: Principles, Guidelines, and Practices</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 172.</span> Put more simply, management is all about achieving organizational objectives through people and other resources.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_002">David L. Kurtz, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011), 254.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Management principles apply to all organizations—large or small, for-profit or not-for-profit. Even one-person small businesses need to be concerned about management principles because without a fundamental understanding of how businesses are managed, there can be no realistic expectation of success. Remember that the most common reason attributed to small business failure is failure on the part of management.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p01">On any given day, small business owners and managers will engage in a mix of many different kinds of activities—for example, deal with crises as they arise, read, think, write, talk to people, arrange for things to be done, have meetings, send e-mails, conduct performance evaluations, and plan. Although the amount of time that is spent on each activity will vary, all the activities can be assigned to one or more of the five management functions: planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling (<a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_f01">Figure 12.1 "Management Functions"</a>).</p>

Each person in the business should know who is responsible for what, have the authority to carry out his or her responsibilities, and not get conflicting instructions from different bosses.
