    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_p02">Given these odds, planning for disaster recovery makes great sense—even if, in the end, walking away makes the most sense. If a small business owner decides to rebuild, the process can begin after human health and safety are restored, the electricity is back on, and transportation is up and running. Everyone will want life to return to normal following the destruction, but that may not be possible for every small business. The market may change. Conditions may change, and a business must change to succeed in disaster recovery.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_003">Darrell Zahorsky, “Disaster Recovery Decision Making for Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/disastermanagement/a/disasterrecover.htm">sbinformation.about.com/od/disastermanagement/a/disasterrecover.htm</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p01">In the film <em class="emphasis">Apollo 13</em>, astronauts and engineers went through seemingly endless simulations of what might go wrong on a flight to the moon. The astronauts complained that some of the scenarios were unrealistic and almost impossible to occur. But when a near disaster occurred on Apollo 13, the engineers and astronauts were confronted with a problem that had never been considered; however, because of their prior experience with disaster training, they were able to develop a solution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p02">Rather than being negative, anticipating what can go wrong can be profoundly positive through either prevention or quickly responding to a crisis. The wise small business owner should appreciate Murphy’s Law (“Anything that can go wrong will go wrong”) and Murphy’s first corollary (“And it will go wrong at the worst possible moment”). The most pragmatic small business owner will also realize that Murphy was an optimist.</p>

He owns Western Beverage, Inc., a beverage distribution company serving twenty-nine counties in western Kansas. In 2002, Western Beverage sustained millions of dollars in fire damage. Yet the company resumed deliveries after just three days. Bogner was named the Kansas City Small Businessperson of the Year for 2006, partially because of his company’s ability to respond to adversity. As his nomination package stated, “Setting up plans of action and following through are Joe’s way of life.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_p01">A business owner has invested a tremendous amount of time, money, resources, and emotions into building a business, so he or she will want to be able to survive a natural or man-made disaster. This requires taking a proactive approach so that the chances of the business surviving are increased. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to guarantee the survival of a business because there is no way to know what kind of disaster may occur—or when. There is also no way to know what kind of business environment the owner will face after the disaster. There are, however, several things can be done to increase those chances of survival. Resist the temptation to put emergency planning on the back burner.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_s01_p01">It is important to look realistically at the types of disasters that might affect a business internally and externally and prepare a risk assessment. Consider the natural disasters that are most common in the areas where the business operates and think about the business’s vulnerability to man-made disasters. Fires are the most common disasters in the United States, and they are extremely destructive to businesses,<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_014">“Fires,” <em class="emphasis">American Red Cross</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sdarc.org/HowWeHelp/DisasterPreparedness/Fire/tabid/81/Default.aspx">www.sdarc.org/HowWeHelp/DisasterPreparedness/Fire/tabid/81/Default.aspx</a>.</span> but an owner may not be aware that a community is very vulnerable to flooding from snow melt or that the proximity to a chemical plant makes a business vulnerable to the results of explosions.

                <li>Carefully assess how the business functions. Document internal key personnel and backups (i.e., the personnel without whom a business absolutely cannot function). The list should be as large as necessary but as small as possible.</li>
                <li>Identify suppliers, shippers, resources, and other businesses that are interacted with on a daily basis. Document these and other external contacts, such as bankers, attorneys, information technology (IT) consultants, utilities, and municipal and community offices (police, fire, etc.) that may be needed for assistance.</li>
                <li>Identify people who can telecommute. Take steps to ensure that critical staff can telecommute if necessary.</li>
                <li>Plan for payroll continuity.</li>

Critical documents include articles of incorporation and other legal papers, utility bills, banking information, and human resources documents; all these will be required to start over again.

                <li>Put all the information together. The continuity plan is an important document, a copy of which should be given to all key personnel. Do not distribute the plan to people who do not need to have it. The plan will contain sensitive and secure information that could be used by a disgruntled employee for inappropriate purposes.</li>
                <li>Plan to change the plan. There will always be events that could not have been factored into the plan. For example, the contingency site is damaged beyond use or the business’s bank is in an area that will be without power for days.

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Explore cybersecurity liability insurance.</strong> This coverage is available at reasonable rates to protect against credit card identity theft, with limits up to $5 million. This insurance will cover the loss of digital assets plus expenses for public relations, damages, and service interruption. It will also protect customers. The notification of customers whose credit was compromised is included plus any legal costs and a year of credit monitoring for each individual affected. Although other cybersecurity insurance policies can cover data loss, applicants must break down loss estimates on an hourly basis because most breaches are resolved in hours, not days. This is not an easy thing to do.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use antivirus software and keep it up to date.</strong> If an owner is not already doing this, he or she should probably have a mental examination.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Do not open e-mail from unknown sources.</strong> Always be suspicious of unexpected e-mails that include attachments, whether or not they are from a known source. When in doubt, delete the file and the attachment—and then empty the computer’s deleted items file. This should be a procedure that all employees know about and follow. The owner must do it as well.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Use hard-to-guess passwords.</strong> An application for cyberinsurance requires, among other things, answering the following question: “Are passwords required to be at least seven characters in length, alphanumeric, and free of consecutive characters?” (Check yes or no.) Whether or not a business plans to apply for cyberinsurance, instituting this kind of password policy is well worth consideration.</li>

                    <li>Small- to medium-sized businesses are the most vulnerable in the event of a disaster.</li>
                    <li>Some estimates claim that over 60 percent of small businesses that experience a major disaster close by the end of the second year.</li>
                    <li>Planning for disaster recovery makes great sense for protecting a business.</li>
                    <li>Every state and territory has experienced disasters. Planning for the aftermath is the key to getting back to business with a minimum of disruption. However, every situation will be unique.</li>
                    <li>Man-made disasters affect 10 percent of small businesses, while natural disasters have impacted more than 30 percent of all small businesses in the United States.</li>
                    <li>A man-made disaster is a disastrous event caused directly and principally by one or more identifiable deliberate or negligent human actions—for example, arson, terrorism, and structural collapse.</li>
                    <li>The better prepared a business is, the faster it will recover from a disaster and resume operations. Having a disaster plan can mean the difference between being shut down for a few days and going out of business entirely.</li>
                    <li>Even the smallest business should have a disaster plan.</li>
                    <li>The three main areas that an owner should focus on in a disaster plan are the plan to stay in business, talk to people, and protect the investment.</li>

Many small businesses were lost, never to reopen, while others sustained major physical and economic damage. Frank’s son, Robert, asked his father about whether he was prepared for something like that. Frank’s response was troubling. Although he kept some important documents in a safety deposit box at the bank, there was little planning or protection. Robert explained the importance of disaster planning, but Frank was overwhelmed by the prospect of the process.</p>
