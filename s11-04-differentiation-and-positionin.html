One way to uncover differentiation possibilities is to examine customer experience with a product or a service by asking the following questions:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_031">Ian C.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p01">Positioning is about the mind of the consumer: placing a company or a brand (sometimes they are the same, e.g., Carbonite, CakeLove, and Sugar Bakery &amp; Sweet Shop) in the consumer’s mind in relation to the competition.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_032">Al Ries and Jack Trout, <em class="emphasis">Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), 3.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p02">The positioning decision is often the critical strategic decision for a company or a brand because the position can be central to customers’ perception and choice decisions. Further, because all elements of the marketing program can potentially affect the position, it is usually necessary to use a positioning strategy as a focus for developing the marketing program. A clear positioning strategy can ensure that the elements of the marketing program are consistent and supportive.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_033">David A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p03">Both big and small businesses practice positioning, but small businesses may not know it as positioning. The small business owner thinks about positioning intuitively, does not use the terminology, and does not always know how to promote the position. Additionally, in many if not most small businesses, “the positioning of products is based on the opinions of the business owner, his or her family, and selected friends and family.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_034">“Product Positioning,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/product-positioning.html">www.inc.com/encyclopedia/product-positioning.html</a>.</span> This notwithstanding, an understanding of positioning should be in every small business owner’s tool kit.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by price/quality.</strong> A very pervasive approach to positioning. Some small companies and brands offer more in terms of service, features, or performance, and a higher price serves to signal this higher quality to the customer. As an example, Derry Church Artisan Chocolates are very expensive, but they position themselves as having the very high quality that justifies a high price.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_036">Jim T.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by use or application.</strong> Focuses on how a product is used or different applications of the product. A solitary custom tailoring shop located in a downtown professional office area could position itself as the only tailor where you can conveniently go “for lunch.”</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by product user.</strong> The focus shifts from the product to the user. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kindsnacks.com/">KIND Snacks</a> are cereal bars positioned as a snack bar for those who are interested in a snack that is wholesome, convenient, tasty, healthy, and “economically sustainable and socially impactful.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_037">“Our Story,” <em class="emphasis">KIND Healthy Snacks</em>, accessed December 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kindsnacks.com/our-story">www.kindsnacks.com/our-story</a>.</span> It is a great snack for hikers and campers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by product class.</strong> Focuses on product-class associations.
