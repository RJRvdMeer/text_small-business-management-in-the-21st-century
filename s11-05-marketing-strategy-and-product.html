    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_p01">The key element in the marketing mix is the product. Without it, price, promotion, and place are moot. The same is true for marketing strategy. Fulfilling a company’s vision and mission and achieving its marketing objectives must be led by the product.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_p02">There are multiple decisions and considerations that factor into product or service development: features and benefits, product mix, design, brand, the product life cycle, and the company website. Knowing product development issues can be very helpful for even the smallest business that is looking to keep its current product line responsive to the customers while also looking to expand its product line as the company grows (if growth is desired).</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p01">A product has multiple layers: core, augmented, and symbolic. These three layers can help a small business owner understand the product features and benefits that will best deliver value to current and prospective customers. These layers also provide the bases for differentiating and positioning the product. The product layers refer to both products and services and business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B) customers.</p>

It is also the basic benefit or problem solution that B2C or B2B customers are looking for. Someone buying an airline ticket, for example, is buying transportation.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_044">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E. Clow, <em class="emphasis">Essentials of Marketing</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 226.</span> Someone buying an ice cream cone is buying a delicious and fun treat. The core layer is also where considerations of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quality</a><span class="glossdef">Overall product quality, reliability, and the extent to which a product or a service meets consumers’ needs.</span></span> begin. Quality “refers to overall product quality, reliability, and the extent to which [the product or the service] meets consumers’ needs,” and the perception of quality has the greatest impact on customer satisfaction.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_045">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E.

The augmented layer for Southwest Airlines is its well-known brand name, its packaging and promotion as a “fun” flying experience, and its “bags fly free” policy. The ice cream cone that is purchased in an old-fashioned ice cream parlor will likely be considered of greater value to many customers than the ice cream cone purchased at a Dairy Queen. It is this layer where many marketing mistakes are made because opportunities are missed. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">symbolic layer</a><span class="glossdef">The meaning of a product to a consumer—its emotional and psychological connections.</span></span> captures the meaning of a product to a consumer—its emotional and psychological connections. There are many loyal customers of Southwest Airlines because they really enjoy flying with them. It is inexpensive, convenient, and fun. The old-fashioned ice cream parlor will engender nostalgia and create powerful emotional ties. The most serious marketing errors are made when the symbolic product layer is either ignored or not understood. The power of symbolism should never be underestimated.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s01_p03">Every small business should look at its products within the context of the product layers. It is the creativity and imagination of the small business owner with the product layers that can set a business apart. They provide an excellent basis for dissecting an existing product to see where opportunities may have been missed, features could be added or changed, and features or enhancements could be explained more effectively in promotional activities. The product layers should also be used to develop new products that the business plans to introduce.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Product Mix</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_p01">All small businesses have a product mix, the selection of products or services that is offered to the marketplace. With respect to the product mix for small companies, a company will usually start out with a limited product mix. However, over time, a company may want to differentiate products or acquire new ones to enter new markets. A company can also sell existing products to new markets by coming up with new uses for its products.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_046">Rick Suttle, “What Is a Product Mix?,” <em class="emphasis">Chron.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/product-mix-639.html">smallbusiness.chron.com/product-mix-639.html</a>.</span> No matter the approach, the product mix needs to be created so that it is responsive to the needs, wants, and desires of the small business’s target market.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s02_p02">For small businesses engaged in e-marketing, product selection is a key element for online success. Part of the challenge is deciding which products to market online because some products sell better online than others.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_047">Jan Zimmerman, <em class="emphasis">Web Marketing for Dummies</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2009), 101.</span> If a business has a brick-and-mortar presence, a decision must be made whether all the inventory or only part of it will be sold online. Items that sell well online change over time, so it is important to keep up to date on the changes.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_048">Jan Zimmerman, <em class="emphasis">Web Marketing for Dummies</em>, 2nd ed. (Hoboken, NJ: Wiley, 2009), 101.</span> A second decision to be made is the number of items in the catalog (i.e., the number of items you will sell). Given intense online competition and shoppers’ desires for good selections, there needs to be a critical mass of products and choices—unless a company is lucky enough to have a very narrow niche with high demand. If a company has only one or two products to sell, the situation should be evaluated to determine whether selling online will be profitable.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_049">Jan Zimmerman, <em class="emphasis">Web Marketing for Dummies</em>, 2nd ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p04">Design is particularly important in making and marketing retail services, apparel, packaged goods, and durable equipment. The designer must figure out how much to invest in form, feature development, performance, conformance, durability, reliability, repairability, and style. To the company, a well-designed product is one that is easy to manufacture and distribute. To the customer, a well-designed product is one that is pleasant to look at and easy to open, install, use, repair, and dispose of. The designer must take all these factors into account.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s03_p07">Design issues also apply to services. Some of the design issues for services that are delivered in a store (e.g., dry cleaning, repair, and restaurant) are the same as for any retail store: the design of the physical space, the appearance of the personnel, the helpfulness of the personnel, the ease of ordering, and the quality of service delivery. For services that are performed at a customer’s home or at a business site, the design issues include timeliness; the appearance and helpfulness of personnel; the quality of installation, service, and repair; and the ease of ordering the service.

The reality is that there are many small businesses that do very well for themselves without a web presence. The small local deli, accounting or insurance services, a legal firm, a liquor store, or a dental office may not see the need for a website. At the same time, customers are increasingly expecting a web presence, so any small business that does not have a website runs the risk of losing sales because of it. The time may also be approaching when not having a website will be perceived as odd, with questions raised as to the seriousness of the business.
