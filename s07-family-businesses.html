        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p01">In 1957, Westbrook Lobster opened in Westbrook, Connecticut, as a specialized lobster and fish market. As time went on, the company expanded to offer a comprehensive range of fish, shrimp, and prepared foods. In 1989, Larry Larivere, who grew up near the docks of New Bedford, Massachusetts, bought the business and had a dream of expanding the business with a seafood restaurant.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p02">Fast forward to 2004. Larry and his two sons, Michael (an environmental science major) and Matthew (a business major), opened up their second restaurant in Wallingford, Connecticut. It overlooks the Quinnipiac River in the historic Yale Brother’s Mill built in the late 1670s. Originally a grain mill, later converted to a German and Britannia silver spoon factory, and finally converted into a restaurant, the building was rich with history.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p03">Michael speaks easily about the value that Westbrook Lobster offers its customers: high quality food, great service…and visiting the tables while people are dining. He sees these visits as an important part of the relationships that he has built with his customers over the years. Westbrook customers eagerly await the monthly postcards that are sent out that feature dining specials, discounts, and coupons. He tries to get the postcards out early and actually receives phone calls if they are not received early. Many people have come to depend on them. Michael says that these postcards definitely give the restaurant its greatest return. The restaurant has a presence on Facebook, but that is geared to the bar crowd—a younger crowd.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p04">Technology plays an important but mixed part in the restaurant’s operations. Michael says that it is tough to run a restaurant these days without technology tools like POS (point of service) systems. These systems include touch screens for placing orders and paying for food items. Interestingly, however, most food vendors still do their business face to face (or telephone to telephone), choosing to stick with personal relationships. Only a few suppliers, such as liquor vendors, accept orders online.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p05">The current Westbrook Lobster website was created by Michael and Matthew using services from intuit.com. They built the site themselves and are proud to note that restaurant gift cards can now be purchased directly from the site. This is a perfect example of Web 2.0 capabilities.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p06">As far as running the business, currently fifty employees strong, Larry Larivere (Dad) is brought in on the big decisions. Otherwise, Michael and Mathew run the restaurants on their own. There are currently no other family members in the business.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p07">Westbrook Lobster continues to provide the freshest seafood available at competitive prices. The daily selection includes everything from locally harvested shellfish to fresh fish from waters up and down the East Coast. They also offer several “healthy” options that are made without butter or bread crumbs. These menu items are very popular and are especially attractive for people with food allergies or people who just want to eat a bit lighter. All their efforts continue to pay off. Westbrook Lobster was voted “Best Seafood Restaurant Statewide” in <em class="emphasis">Connecticut Magazine</em> 2009 and “Best Seafood in New Haven County” in <em class="emphasis">Connecticut Magazine</em> 2009 and 2010.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_p08">Larry, Michael, and Matthew invite you to Westbrook Lobster when you are in the area. Once you are there, you are family.</p>

                <li>One of the popular misconceptions about family businesses is that they are unable to adapt easily to increasing competitiveness and technological progress. The reality is that family businesses frequently have the advantage of entrepreneurial spirit, flexibility, and opportunism.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_010">“Myths and Realities of Family Business,” 2002, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf">www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf</a>.</span>
</li>
                <li>It is believed by some that family firms are “too soft” and rarely reach their potential. The reality is that family businesses actually outperform public companies. Oftentimes, the marketplace forces public companies to make short-term decisions, whereas a family business has the advantage of having more freedom to make its decisions. Family businesses can adapt to market fluctuations more easily because they can afford to be patient. They have common goals, shared values, and a commitment to brand building.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_011">“Myths and Realities of Family Business,” 2002, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf">www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf</a>.</span>
</li>
                <li>Family-owned businesses are often seen as ideal because family members form a “grounded and loyal foundation” for the company, and family members tend to exhibit more dedication to their common goals. “Having a certain level of intimacy among the owners of a business can help bring about familiarity with the company and having family members around provides a built-in support system that should ensure teamwork and solidarity.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_012">Alexis Writing, “Pros and Cons of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Chron.com</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-family-business-409.html">smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-family-business-409.html</a>.</span>
</li>
                <li>The culture of a family business is very different from that of a company you will find on Wall Street. “Family businesses frequently take a very long-term point of view. They’ll make investments that they don’t expect to pay off for 5 or 15 or 25 years…Culture in a family business is more frequently based on very personal and emotional values. It’s stronger because there are deeper roots and closer connections to the history of the company.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_013">Margaret Steen, “The Decision Tree of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Graduate School of Business</em>, August 2006, accessed June 21, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html">www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html</a>.</span>

This creates more pressure on those who join to make sure that they produce. “This emphasis on professionalism has made family businesses both more daunting and more attractive—and has created new interest in them, from family members, outsiders, and business school students.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_016">Margaret Steen, “The Decision Tree of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Graduate School of Business</em>, August 2006, accessed June 21, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html">www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html</a>.</span>

</li>
                <li>Family businesses tend to operate more ethically. In fact, many family businesses believe that their ethical standards are more stringent than those of their competitors. In addition, family businesses are often deeply embedded in their communities, and this proximity is seen as an important factor that increases the likelihood of ethical decision making and moral behavior.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_020">“American Family Business Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Mass Mutual Financial Group</em>, 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf">www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf</a>.</span> As members of the local community, any ethical problems with a family business will be quickly visible.</li>
                <li>Family businesses also exhibit more social responsibility than their competitors.

                <li>Family businesses may incur lower costs because of the greater willingness of family members to make financial sacrifices for the sake of the business.

When Freud was asked what he considered to be the secret of a full life, he gave a three-word answer: ‘<em class="emphasis">Lieben und arbeiten</em> [to love and to work].’ For most people, the two most important things in their lives are their families and their work. It is easy to understand the compelling power of organizations that combine both. Being in a family firm affects all the participants. The role of chairman of the board is different when the company was founded by your father and when your mother and siblings sit around the table at board meetings, just as they sat around the dinner table. The job of a CEO is different when the vice president in the next office is also a younger sister. The role of partner is different when the other partner is a spouse or a child. The role of sales representative is different when you cover the same territory that your parent did twenty-five years earlier, and your grandparent twenty-five years before that. Even walking through the door on your first day of work on an assembly line or in a billing office is different if the name over the door is your own.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_030">Kelin E.

The challenge is in attracting and retaining nonfamily employees because these employees “may find it difficult to deal with family conflicts on the job, limited opportunities for advancement, and the special treatment sometimes accorded family members. In addition, some family members may resent outsiders being brought into the firm and purposely make things unpleasant for nonfamily employees.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_061">“Family Owned Businesses Law and Legal Definition,” <em class="emphasis">USLegal.com</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://definitions.uslegal.com/f/family-owned-businesses">definitions.uslegal.com/f/family-owned-businesses</a>.</span> Because it is likely that a growing family business will need to hire people from the outside, it is important that the business come to terms with that necessity. Policies and procedures can help with the transition, but the most important thing is to prepare the family culture of the business to accept a nonfamily member.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p02">There are several problems with this way of thinking.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p03">Second, professional managers are not always prepared to deal with the special nature of family-owned businesses. “The influence of families on businesses they own and manage is often invisible to management theorists and business schools.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p05">The hiring of an outside manager, therefore, should include an assessment of both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formal competence</a><span class="glossdef">Formal education, training, and experience outside the family business.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cultural competence</a><span class="glossdef">An understanding of the culture of a specific firm.</span></span>. Formal competence refers to formal education, training, and experience outside the family business.

                <li>They consider fair compensation to be equal compensation for all family members, sometimes even for the owner. This creates a very sticky situation because all family members are not created equal. “It is sometimes difficult to assess and compare the talents of family members who are also employees. Nor do all family members contribute equally to the business. As a result of the stress that this causes, many family business owners ignore the problem and let compensation become a breeding ground for dissension in the family.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_079">Kathy Marshack, “How to Arrive at Fair Compensation in a Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">American Chronicle</em>, February 29, 2008, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/53757">www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/53757</a>.</span>

                <li>They do not compensate wives for the work they do. The reason often given? It saves on taxes. Not surprisingly, this approach leaves wives isolated from the business, invisible in the decision-making process, and unappreciated.

The average salary of the typical son in a family business was $115,000, while his sister earned only $19,000. This may be due to the tendency of sons being groomed for leadership, while daughters are groomed for the supportive roles that command lower salaries.</li>
                <li>The compensation for family members is higher than that for nonfamily members, but the differential is not tied to the actual job requirements or performance.

It eases the founder’s concerns about transferring the firm to someone else and provides time in which to prepare for a major change in lifestyle. It encourages the heirs to work in the business, rather than embarking on alternative careers, because they can see what roles they will be able to play. And it endeavors to provide what is best for the business; in other words, it recognizes that managerial ability is more important than birthright, and that appointing an outside candidate may be wiser than entrusting the company to a relative who has no aptitude for the work.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_094">“Making a Difference: The PricewaterhouseCoopers Family Business Survey 2007/08,” <em class="emphasis">PriceWaterhouseCoopers</em>, November 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pwc.com/en_TH/th/publications/assets/pwc_fbs_survey.pdf">www.pwc.com/en_TH/th/publications/assets/pwc_fbs_survey.pdf</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Establish goals and objectives.</strong> As the family business owner, you must establish your personal goals and vision for the business and your future role in its operation. You should include your retirement goals, family member goals, goals of other stakeholders (e.g., partners, shareholders, and employees), and goals relating to what should happen in the case of your illness, death, or disability.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Family involvement in the decision-making process.</strong> If the family and stakeholders who are involved in the decision-making process are kept informed of the decisions being made, many of the problems related to inheritance, management, and ownership issues will be alleviated. Communication, the process for handling family change and disputes, the family vision for the business, and the relationship between the family and the business should be addressed. The surest path to family discord is developing the succession plan on your own and then announcing it.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_098">Susan Ward, “Six Business Succession Planning Tips,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, 2011, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm</a>.</span>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Identify successor(s).</strong> This section of the plan will address the issue of who takes over ownership and management of the business. Identification of the potential successor(s), training of the successor(s), building support for the successor(s), and teaching the successor(s) to build vision for the business are included here. Working with your successor(s) for a year or two before you hand over the business will increase the chances for success.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_099">Susan Ward, “Six Business Succession Planning Tips,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, 2011, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Estate planning.</strong> Estate planning is important if you are planning to retire or want to take precautionary measures regarding the future of the business in the event you are unable to continue operation of the family business due to illness, disability, or death. You should consult a lawyer, an accountant, a financial/estate planner, and a life insurance representative so that your benefits will be maximized. You will need to consider taxation, retirement income, provisions for other family members, and active/nonactive family members.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Contingency planning.</strong> Contingency planning is about unforeseen circumstances. It is about strategizing for the most likely “what if” scenarios (e.g., your death or disability). By thinking in terms of the unforeseen, you will be taking a proactive rather than reactive approach.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Company structure and transfer methods.</strong> This section of the succession plan involves the review and updating of the organizational and structural plan for the organization taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the successor. The following needs to be identified: the roles and the responsibilities of the successor, the filling of key positions, structuring of the business to fit the successor, the potential roles for the retiring owner, any legal complications, and financial issues.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Business valuation.</strong> This section is relevant only if the business is being sold. Passing the business to a family member would not involve a business valuation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exit strategy.</strong> With any succession, ownership will be transferred, and you will remove yourself from the day-to-day operations of the business. Alternatives will be compared, and a framework for making your final choices will be developed. The transfer method and the timelines are decided. The exit plan should then be published and distributed to everyone who is involved in the succession process.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Implementation and follow-up.</strong> The succession plan should be reviewed regularly and revised as situations change. It should be a dynamic and a flexible document.</li>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Rivalry.</strong> Harry Levinson from the Harvard Business School maintains that, “the fundamental psychological conflict in family businesses is rivalry, compounded by feelings of guilt, when more than one family member is involved.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_113">Harry Levinson, “Conflicts That Plague Family Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 71 (1971): 90–98.</span> This rivalry can occur between father and son, siblings, husband and wife, father and daughter, and in-laws with members of the family that own the business.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Differing vision.</strong> Family members will often disagree with the founder and with each other about the vision and strategy for the business. These differences “can create fear, anger, and destructive attempts to control decisions that are divisive and counter-productive to making and implementing sound decisions.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_114">“Common Sources of Dysfunctional Conflict in Family Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">RJW Consulting</em>, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rjweissconsulting.com/businessDevelopmentNewsDetail.asp?ID=2">www.rjweissconsulting.com/businessDevelopmentNewsDetail.asp?ID=2</a>.</span> Rivalries that spill into the workplace can get nasty, leading to destructive behaviors.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Jealousy.</strong> There is always the potential for jealousy in the family business. It can arise from feelings of unfairness in such things as compensation, job responsibilities, promotions, “having the ear” of the business founder, and stock distributions. It can also arise with respect to the planned successor when there is a difference of opinion about who it should be. If it is not resolved, jealousy has the potential to divide the family and destroy the business.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_115">Nigel Finch, “Identifying and Addressing the Causes of Conflict in Family Business,” Working Paper Series: University of Sydney, May 2005, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=717262">papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=717262</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Succession.</strong> Succession is always a big obstacle for a family business. In some cases, the founder may feel that his or her children are not capable of running the business. This will cause obvious tension between the parent and the child/children, such that the child or children may leave the business in frustration.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_116">Nigel Finch, “Identifying and Addressing the Causes of Conflict in Family Business,” Working Paper Series: University of Sydney, May 2005, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=717262">papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=717262</a>.</span> This, in turn, becomes problematic for succession. “Who gets what type of equity, benefit, title, or role can be major sources of explicit conflict or implicit but destructive behaviors.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_117">“Common Sources of Dysfunctional Conflict in Family Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">RJW Consulting</em>, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rjweissconsulting.com/businessDevelopmentNewsDetail.asp?ID=2">www.rjweissconsulting.com/businessDevelopmentNewsDetail.asp?ID=2</a>.</span> It is also true that while the founder of the business wants to continue family ownership and leadership of the business, this may not be true of his or her immediate family or later-generation family members.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_118">Peter S.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Playing by different rules.</strong> This cause of negative conflict “often presents itself as a form of elitism or entitlement that exists simply by virtue of being in a family that owns a business. Examples show up in allowing one or more family members to exhibit deficient standards of conduct or performance that violate sound business practices or important requirements that all other employees are expected to follow. Such behaviors can be divisive and demoralizing to all employees and customers as well as harmful to the reputation of the business.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_119">“Common Sources of Dysfunctional Conflict in Family Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">RJW Consulting</em>, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.rjweissconsulting.com/businessDevelopmentNewsDetail.asp?ID=2">www.rjweissconsulting.com/businessDevelopmentNewsDetail.asp?ID=2</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Decision making.</strong> If roles and responsibilities are not clearly defined, conflict will arise over who can make decisions and how decisions should be made. This will lead to confusion, uncertainty, and haphazard decisions that will put the company at risk.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Compensation and benefits.</strong> “This is one of the most frequent sources of conflict, especially among members of the younger generation.” A person’s compensation is inextricably linked to his or her feelings of importance and self-worth. Compound that with the emotions associated with being a member of the family that owns the business, and you have the potential for explosive negative conflict.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p01">Some measure of family squabbling is expected in a family business. Some of the arguments will be logical and necessary. However, “it’s important that they remain professional and not personal, because squabbling among family members in a work environment can make the employees and customers feel extremely uncomfortable, and can give them grounds for legal claims against the business.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_121">“How Family Squabbling Affects Other Employees—and Customers,” <em class="emphasis">National Federation of Independent Business</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150">www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150</a>.</span> The negative effects of family squabbling are as follows:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_122">“How Family Squabbling Affects Other Employees—and Customers,” <em class="emphasis">National Federation of Independent Business</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150">www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150</a>.</span></p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Unprofessional image.</strong> Family squabbling conjures up images of children—immaturity and pettiness. This sends a signal to customers and other employees that they are not in a professional environment that focuses on the right things.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Uncomfortable environment.</strong> It is embarrassing to witness squabbling. No one likes to be in an awkward atmosphere; squabbling can cost you customers and employees, and it may result in expensive and unpleasant lawsuits. This can affect your bottom line very quickly.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Discrimination.</strong> Nepotism is one of the biggest dangers of working in a family business. Arguing with relatives will only reinforce to other employees that they are in a family business. This can quickly lead to feelings of disparate treatment which, in turn, can lead to discrimination charges.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Legal troubles.</strong> In the worst cases of family squabbling, disagreements over business can lead to lawsuits. If one family member’s role is minimized and his or her authority is restricted, this is violating the person’s rights as a shareholder. This can lead to an oppressed minority shareholder suit against the family business. This would be expensive, it would be ugly, and it could lead to the demise of the company.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p02">Avoiding conflict is no easy feat. However, there are several things that a family business should consider. First, there are consultants who engage in conflict resolution for a living. The possibilities should be checked out. If the budget can handle the costs of a consultant, it could be the best choice. A consultant, having no reason to take one side or the other, will bring the necessary objectivity to resolution of the conflict.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p03">Second, emotional reactions should be differentiated from problem-solving reactions. Family members need to take a professional perspective rather than that of an irritated sibling, parent, son, or daughter.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_123">“How Family Squabbling Affects Other Employees—and Customers,” <em class="emphasis">National Federation of Independent Business</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150">www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150</a>.</span> It will probably be difficult to do this, but it is important that it be done.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p04">Third, focus on the professional role instead of the family role. “Make sure it’s clear what the expectations and attitudes of all your employees are…Because you’re a small business, you might not have as strict a policy as a large corporation, but it would still be helpful to put it in writing, such as in an employee handbook, which carries legal responsibilities to both family and outside employees.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_124">“How Family Squabbling Affects Other Employees—and Customers,” <em class="emphasis">National Federation of Independent Business</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150">www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p05">Fourth, encourage honesty from the beginning. When first starting to work together, it is important that family members sit down together to talk about potential conflicts that might arise. Acknowledging that it will be more difficult to work together because of being family is a good beginning. Treating family members and the professional environment with respect and expecting honesty when someone steps over the line should make for a smoother process.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_125">“How Family Squabbling Affects Other Employees—and Customers,” <em class="emphasis">National Federation of Independent Business</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150">www.nfib.com/business-resources/business-resources-item?cmsid=52150</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s03_s02_p06">Last, the founder should try to keep the conflict constructive.

                <li>The founder of XYZ company has decided to retire. He wants one of three children to take over leadership of the business—and he knows exactly who it should be. Other members of the family have their ideas as well. One segment of the family wants the oldest son, Michael, to take over, but the founder thinks Michael is a melon head. The second son, Christopher, is a well-meaning and hard-working part of the business, but he just does not have what it takes to be a leader. Nonetheless, he is favored by another group of family members. Samantha, the youngest child, is as sharp as a tack, with solid experience and accomplishments under her belt. On an objective basis, Samantha would be the best choice for the business. She is the founder’s choice to take over the company and has other family supporters as well, although not as many as for Michael or Christopher. This is a situation tailor-made for conflict. How does the founder finesse the selection of Samantha and minimize the conflict that is bound to occur? Can he win?</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p01">It is estimated that about 40 percent of US family-owned businesses survive into second generation businesses, but only about 13 percent are passed down successfully to a third generation. One of the main reasons for this is that technological change moves so swiftly that it bypasses the older generation. “Unless the next generation is poised to update, and can get buy-in from longtime employees wedded to ‘the way we always did it,’ a business can quickly become obsolete.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_135">Karen E.

                <li>Family businesses offer increased customer value because they are associated with families instead of impersonal corporate entities.</li>
                <li>Not all family businesses may choose to integrate digital technology, e-business, and e-commerce into their planning and operations. The level of integration will occur on a continuum. Given the extent to which digital technology pervades business, however, it will be difficult to ignore it. The same is true for e-business and e-commerce.</li>

Interview the owner(s) of each business and ask them to describe the customer value that they offer. Compare your thoughts with what the owners said. Are they different? How? If they are different, what might account for the differences?</li>

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p03">“From the day he opened his jewelry store in 1980, Michael Genovese, 57, expected his son Joseph, now 32, to come into and eventually take over the business. Joe started working there part time while still in junior high, engraving and polishing. ‘Dad offered me a job, and I jumped at it,’ he recalls. He did repairs, made jewelry, and worked in sales. ‘He worked hard and did the dirtiest jobs’ as he learned the business from the bottom up, says Mike.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p04">“After graduating from college, Joe returned to the store, although Mike had urged him to first ‘get some different experience working in another job.’”</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p05">“Back in the store, Joe was soon out-selling the other salespeople. Mike also began gradually training him in management duties—i.e., buying, working with vendors, personnel duties (like hiring and firing), financial matters, and managing sales staff—as he groomed him to lead the business. ‘I never had a written [transition] plan, says Mike, ‘but in my mind I planned this from the time he was a kid working here.’”</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s04_s03_p06">Then disaster struck. Mike had a serious heart attack. He was incapacitated by bypass surgery and months of recovery. Everything started going haywire. Joe’s older brother, who never before had any interest, has now expressed an interest in the business. He has had several years of experience in another job and feels that it would be appropriate to come into the business at a high salary. In the meantime, the other salespeople are beginning to express dissatisfaction with their compensation and benefit plans, feeling that Joe has always received special treatment. There is a lot of dissension at the jewelry store. Joe is ready to tear his hair out. What should he do?<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_136">William George Shuster, “Family Business in Crisis: Letting Go,” <em class="emphasis">JCK Magazine</em>, March 2003, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.jckonline.com/article/282706-Family_Business_in_Crisis_Letting_Go.php">www.jckonline.com/article/282706-Family _Business_in_Crisis_Letting_Go.php</a>.</span></p>
