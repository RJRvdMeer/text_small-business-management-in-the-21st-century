            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Getting internal buy-in.</strong> Because going overseas to do business is a larger undertaking than many businesses realize, make sure that senior management and the people who are responsible for implementing and supporting the overseas effort know what the goals are and what is expected of them with respect to oversight and management. Knowing how much senior management time should be and could be allocated is an important part of getting internal buy-in. Look for support from people in all functions of the business.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Making sure that the full costs of overseas hiring are understood.</strong> If people from overseas will be hired, employment regulations and practices are very different. For example, outside the United States, employment benefits often represent a larger percentage of an employee’s salary than in the United States; in the European Union, for example, a full-blown employment contract is needed, not just an offer letter. This tilts the balance of power to the employee at the expense of the company, making termination very difficult. Understanding the full ramifications of hiring people outside the United States has significant implications for a company’s financial success.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Thinking about how the business will manage overseas employees’ expectations.</strong> Different time zones and countries wreak havoc with keeping employees on the same page. Employees hired locally may have very different ideas about what is considered acceptable than a US employee does. Unless expectations and responsibilities are clearly conveyed at the beginning, problems will undoubtedly arise. They may anyway, but perhaps they will not be as serious.</li>

The benefits and risks associated with each strategy depend on many factors. Among them are the type of product or service being produced; the need for product or service support; and the foreign economic, political, business, and cultural environment to be penetrated.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s04_p02">The primary methods of payment for international transactions are payment in advance (the most secure), letters of credit, documentary collection (drafts), consignment, and open account (the least secure), which are described as follows:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_138">Laurel Delaney, “A How-To on Expanding Your Business Globally,” <em class="emphasis">The Global Small Business Blog</em>, January 11, 2011, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://borderbuster.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-to-on-expanding-your-business.html">borderbuster.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-to-on-expanding-your-business.html</a>; US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s04_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cash in advance.</strong> This is the ideal method of payment because a company is relieved of collection problems and has immediate use of the money. Unfortunately, it tends to be an option only when the manufacturing process is specialized, lengthy, or capital intensive and requires partial or progress payments. Wire transfers are commonly used, and many exporters accept credit cards.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Documentary letter of credit.</strong> This is an internationally recognized instrument issued by a bank on behalf of its client, the purchaser. A letter of credit represents the bank’s guarantee to pay the seller, provided that the conditions specified in the letter are fulfilled.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Documentary collection or draft.</strong> This involves the use of a draft, drawn by the seller on the buyer. It requires the buyer to pay the face amount either on sight (sight draft) or on a specified date in the future (time draft). The draft is an unconditional order to make payment in accordance with its terms, which specify the documents needed before title to the goods will be passed. All terms of payment should be clearly specified so that confusion and delay are avoided.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Open account.</strong> With an open account, the exporter bills the customer, who is then expected to pay under agreed-on terms at a future date after the goods are manufactured and delivered (usually with fifteen, thirty, or sixty days). This payment method works well if the buyer is well established, has a long and favorable payment record, or has been thoroughly checked for being creditworthy. This approach is considered risky in international business because a business has limited recourse if debts are unpaid. Small businesses considering this option must examine the political, economic, and commercial risks very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consignment sales.</strong> Goods are shipped to a foreign distributor, which sells them on behalf of the exporter. Title to the goods remains with the exporter until they are sold, at which point payment is sent to the exporter. The exporter has the greatest risk and least control over the goods with this method, and payment may take a while. Risk insurance should be seriously considered with consignment sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s04_p03">When buyers default on their payments, it can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive to obtain payments. A business should contact the buyer and try to negotiate payment. If negotiation fails and the amount of the debt is large enough to make a difference in that business, obtain the assistance and advice of the business’s bank, legal counsel, and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://trade.gov/cs/">US Commercial Service</a>, an organization that can resolve payment problems informally. If arbitration becomes necessary, the  <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.iccwbo.org">International Chamber of Commerce</a> is the place to go.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s05_p01">Having a successful global business requires getting to know the history, the culture, and the customs of the country or countries in which a business hopes to expand. Each country is different from another and the United States in some ways. Some of these differences have been discussed earlier in this chapter. Among the cultural differences to be faced are business styles, attitudes toward business relationships and punctuality, negotiating styles, gift-giving customers, greetings, the significance of gestures, the meanings of colors and numbers, and customs regarding titles. For example, engaging in small talk before conducting business is standard practice in Saudi Arabia, and gift giving is an important part of doing business in Japan.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_140">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s06_p01">After deciding to sell products or services abroad, a carefully researched export plan is a source of direction. An export plan helps a business act on—rather than react to—the challenges and risks encountered in global business. The plan will also help a business obtain financial assistance and find investors, strategic partners, and JV partners that may be needed for success.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_141">“10 Steps to Successful Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/canadaexport/a/10exportsteps.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/od/canadaexport/a/10exportsteps.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s06_p02">There are many elements of an export plan, including a description of the company; its market and industry; its objectives; information on its products or services; an analysis of the target market and industry, including trends and forecasts; an examination of competitors and their strengths and weaknesses; international marketing strategies, including customer profiling and the development of sales and distribution channels; employment and training issues; after-sales and customer service, and financial requirements and forecasts.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_142">“10 Steps to Successful Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/od/canadaexport/a/10exportsteps.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/od/canadaexport/a/10exportsteps.htm</a>.</span> “Many companies launch their export activities haphazardly and are unsuccessful in their early efforts because of poor or no planning, which often leads them to abandon exporting altogether.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_143">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s06_p05">A business’s first export plan should be simple, only a few pages because important market data and planning elements may not be easily available or completely unavailable. The plan should be written and seen as a flexible management document, not a static document that sits on a shelf somewhere gathering dust. Objectives need to be compared against actual results, just as a business would do with its marketing plan and its overall business plan. A business should be open to revising the plan as necessary as new information becomes available and experience is gained.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_144">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s06_l01">
                <li>Before taking a business global, desire to pursue export markets for good rather than frivolous reasons.</li>
                <li>Management commitment must be present for successful global operations.</li>
                <li>A business must decide on some kind of structure to handle its global side. It should be dedicated to ensuring that export sales are adequately serviced.</li>
                <li>Getting internal buy-in is critical.</li>
                <li>A business will need to select the best market(s) to enter. Although Canada, Japan, and Mexico are the largest markets for US products, these countries may not be the best markets for specific products or services.</li>
                <li>Tariffs and nontariff trade barriers can pose serious constraints.</li>
                <li>A business must decide how to enter a foreign market. For example, it can choose direct and indirect exporting, strategic alliances, JVs, and direct foreign investment.</li>
                <li>Being paid in full and on time is of obvious importance, especially considering the difficulties a business will encounter in collecting an unpaid international debt. The most secure method of payment is cash in advance. The least secure is an open account.</li>
                <li>Learning and understanding the business etiquette of the country or countries to which a business is exporting is a very important part of building business relationships.</li>
                <li>A carefully researched export plan is a source of direction, and it will help a business act on—rather than react to—the challenges and risks it will encounter in global business.</li>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s06_l02">
                <li>Go to the Coca-Cola website (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.coca-cola.com/en/index.html">www.coca-cola.com/en/index.html</a>) and select one website from each of the following geographic areas: Latin America, Europe, Eurasia, Africa, and Asia Pacific. Compare the home pages of these sites to the US home page—even though you will not understand the language (unless you are bilingual). Look at the graphics, layout, and uses of color. What are the similarities? What are the differences? To what would you attribute the differences? How would these similarities and differences inform the design of a small business website for conducting global business?</li>
