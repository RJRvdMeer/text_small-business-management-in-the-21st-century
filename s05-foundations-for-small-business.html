        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_p01">Frank Trotta III is a recent college graduate, class of 2009, and an excellent example of the twenty-first-century small business owner. At 23, he is already running his own business and planning to open a second. This may be second nature because Frank III is a third-generation small business owner. His grandfather, Frank Trotta Sr., opened a supermarket in 1945. His son, Frank C. Trotta Jr., began his career by working in the supermarket. Soon he had his own hardware department within the store and was beginning to understand what it takes to be a successful grocer. He observed his dad interacting with his customers and providing value through customer service.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_p02">Frank Jr. now owns and operates one of Long Island’s most successful travel companies: the Prime Time Travel Club. The experience Frank Jr. garnered from his father in customer service became the tenet of his business philosophy: give customers value through personal attention and service. At an early age, Frank III worked in his dad’s office when he was not busy with school activities. He had a strong entrepreneurial leaning and became very interested in the travel industry. In high school, Frank III worked for his dad and learned different facets of the travel business. While attending a Connecticut university, Frank III reached out to other students on campus and started his own side business: booking spring break trips. The same people are now repeat customers who call him to book their vacations, honeymoons, and family trips.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_p03">In his junior year, Frank III created a travel site of his own: Cruisetoanywhere.com. He is involved with every aspect of the site: he takes all calls from the customer service number, produces all the marketing campaigns, and works on contracts with both major and smaller cruise lines. Although the site is still young, it has been very successful. Frank III is learning how larger competitors do business and from their successes and mistakes. Customer service and attention are his first priority. Frank III believes his competitive business edge comes from what he learned from his father’s company and business skills such as planning and managing cash flow from his professors. In addition to his cruise website, Frank III plans to launch another site, Tourstoanywhere.com. He exemplifies the skill set that will characterize the twenty-first-century small business owner: a clear focus on creating value for his customers, a willingness to exploit the benefits of digital technology and e-commerce, and the ability to apply basic business skills to the effective operation of the firm.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_p01">It’s an exciting time to be in small business. This is certainly not anything new, but you might not know it. Scan any issue of the popular business press, and in all probability, you will find a cover story on one of America’s or the world’s major corporations or a spotlight on their CEOs. Newspapers, talk radio, and television seem to have an unlimited supply of pundits and politicians eager to pontificate on firms that have been labeled as “too big to fail.” Listen to any broadcast of a weekday’s evening news program, and there will be a segment that highlights the ups and downs of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) 500. These market measures provide an insight into what is going on in Wall Street. However, they are clearly biased to not only large firms but also huge firms. This creates the false notion that “real” business is only about big business. It fails to recognize that small businesses are the overwhelming majority of all businesses in America; not only are the majority of jobs in small businesses, but small businesses have also been the major driving force in new job creation and innovation. Small business is <em class="emphasis">the</em> dynamo of innovation in our economy. In 2006, Thomas M. Sullivan, the chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA), said, “Small business is a major part of our economy,…small businesses innovate and create new jobs at a faster rate than their larger competitors. They are nimble, creative, and a vital part of every community across the country.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_001">“Small Business by the Numbers,” <em class="emphasis">National Small Business Administration</em>, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nsba.biz/docs/bythenumbers.pdf">www.nsba.biz/docs/bythenumbers.pdf</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">This text is devoted to small business, not entrepreneurship. There has always been a challenge to distinguish—correctly—between the small business owner and the entrepreneur. Some argue that there is no difference between the two terms. The word <em class="emphasis">entrepreneur</em> is derived from a French word for “to undertake,” which might indicate that entrepreneurs should be identified as those who start businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_002">“A Definition of Entrepreneurship,” <em class="emphasis">QuickMBA.com</em>, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quickmba.com/entre/definition">www.quickmba.com/entre/definition</a>.</span> However, this interpretation is too broad and is pointless as a means of distinguishing between the two. Some have tried to find differences based on background, education, or age.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_003">Nick Leiber, “The Anatomy of an Entrepreneur,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, July 8, 2009, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/running_small_business/archives/2009/07/anatomy_of_an_e.html">www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/running_small _business/archives/2009/07/anatomy_of_an_e.html</a>.</span> Often one finds the argument that entrepreneurs have a different orientation toward risk than small business owners. The standard line is that entrepreneurs are willing to take great risks in starting an enterprise and/or willing to start again after a business failure.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_004">“Entrepreneur vs. Small Business Owner: What’s the Difference?,” <em class="emphasis">Mills Communication Group</em>, July 22, 2009, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.millscommgroup.com/blog/2009/06/entrepreneur-vs-small-business-owner-whats-the-difference">www.millscommgroup.com/blog/2009/06/entrepreneur-vs-small-business-owner-whats-the-difference</a>.</span> Others try to make the distinction based on the issue of innovation or the degree of innovation. Given this focus, entrepreneurs need not even work for small business because they can come up with innovative products, services, production, or marketing processes in large organizations.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_005">Dale Beermann, “Entrepreneur or Small Business Owner?

That is not the focus of this text. It centers on the true driving force of America’s economy—the small business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_p03">This chapter gives a brief history of small business in the United States, the critical importance of small business to the American economy, the challenges facing small business owners as they struggle to survive and prosper, the requisite skills to be an effective small business owner, the critical importance of ethical behavior, and how these businesses may evolve over time. In addition, three critical success factors for the twenty-first-century small business are threaded through the text: (1) <em class="emphasis">identifying and providing customer value</em>, (2) <em class="emphasis">being able to exploit digital technologies with an emphasis on e-business and e-commerce</em>, and (3) <em class="emphasis">properly managing your cash flow</em>. These three threads are essential to the successful decision making of any contemporary small business and should be considered of paramount importance. They are everyday considerations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Brief History of Small Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">Throughout American history, from colonial times until today, most businesses were small businesses, and they have played a vital role in America’s economic success and are a forge to our national identity. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the small businessperson has always held an important—even exalted—position in American life. Americans in the early republic were as suspicious of large economic enterprises as threats to their liberty as they were of large government. The historian James L. Houston discussed American suspicion of large economic enterprises: “Americans believed that if property was concentrated in the hands of a few in the republic, those few would use their wealth to control other citizens, seize political power, and warp the republic into an oligopoly.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_006">Jack Beatty, <em class="emphasis">The Age of Betrayal: The Triumph of Money in America 1865–1900</em> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2007), 11.</span> In fact, much of the impetus behind the Boston Tea Party was the fear on the part of local merchants and tradesmen that the East India Company, at that time the world’s largest corporation, was dumping low-priced tea in the colonies, which would have driven local business to ruin.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_007">Ted Nace, <em class="emphasis">The Gangs of America: The Rise of Corporate Power and the Disabling of Democracy</em> (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2003), 44.</span> Jefferson’s promotion of the yeoman farmer, which included small merchants, as the bulwark of democracy stemmed from his fear of large moneyed interests: “The end of democracy and the defeat of the American Revolution will occur when government falls into the hands of lending institutions and moneyed incorporations.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_008">Bob Higgins, “Like Lincoln, Jefferson, Madison—Americans Fear Corporate Control of Public Policy,” <em class="emphasis">TPMCafe</em>, February 17, 2011, accessed October 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/r/l/rlh974/2010/02/like-lincoln-jefferson-madison.php">tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/r/l/rlh974/2010/02/like-lincoln-jefferson -madison.php</a>.</span> So great was the fear of the large aggregation of wealth that the colonies and the early republic placed severe restrictions on the creation of corporate forms. In the first decades of the nineteenth century, state governments restricted the corporate form by limiting its duration, geographic scope, size, and even profits.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_009">Ted Nace, <em class="emphasis">The Gangs of America: The Rise of Corporate Power and the Disabling of Democracy</em> (San Francisco, Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2003), 44.</span> This was done because of the concern that corporations had the potential of becoming monopolies that would drive entrepreneurs out of business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Eventually, however, some businesses grew in size and power. Their growth and size necessitated the development of a professional management class that was distinct from entrepreneurs who started and ran their own businesses. However, not until the post–Civil War period did America see the true explosion in big businesses. This was brought about by several factors: the development of the mass market (facilitated by the railroads); increased capital requirement for mass production; and the 1886 Supreme Court case of <em class="emphasis">Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad</em>, which granted corporations “personhood” by giving them protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">The growth of corporations evoked several responses that were designed to protect small businesses from their larger competitors. The Interstate Commerce Act (1887) was a federal law designed to regulate the rates charged by railroads to protect small farmers and businesses. Other federal laws—the Sherman Act (1890) and the Clayton Act (1914)—were passed with the initial intent of restricting the unfair trading practices of trusts. In the early years, however, the Sherman Act was used more frequently against small business alliances and unions than against large businesses. Congress continued to support small businesses through the passage of legislation. The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937 were designed to protect small retailers from large chain retailers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_010">Mansel Blackford, <em class="emphasis">The History of Small Business in America</em>, 2nd ed. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 4.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p04">The Depression and the post–World War II environments posed special challenges to small business operations. The Hoover and Roosevelt administrations created organizations (the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and the Small War Plants Corporation in 1942) to assist small firms. The functions of several government agencies were subsumed into the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Small Business Administration</a><span class="glossdef">The government agency that is charged with aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting the interests of small business.</span></span> in 1953. The designated purpose of the SBA was to “aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_011">“What We Do,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Administration</em>, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/what-we-do">www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/what-we-do</a>.</span> The SBA functions to ensure that small businesses have a fair chance at securing government contracts. It also has the responsibility of defining what constitutes a small business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p05">If anything is to be learned from the passage of all this legislation, it is that, as Conte (2006) eloquently put it, “Americans continued to revere small businesspeople for their self-reliance and independence.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_012">Christopher Conte, “Small Business in U.S. History,” <em class="emphasis">America.gov</em>, January 3, 2006, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080814215602XJyrreP0.6187664.html">www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080814215602XJyrreP0.6187664.html</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Definition of Small Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p01">The SBA definition of a small business has evolved over time and is dependent on the particular industry. In the 1950s, the SBA defined a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">small business</a><span class="glossdef">A firm that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field of operation. There are variations across industries with respect to competitiveness, entry and exit costs, distribution by size, growth rates, and technological change.</span></span> firm as “independently owned and operated…and not dominant in its field of operation.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_013">Mansel Blackford, <em class="emphasis">The History of Small Business in America</em>, 2nd ed. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 4.</span> This is still part of their definition. At that time, the SBA classified a small firm as being limited to 250 employees for industrial organizations. Currently, this definition depends on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for a business. The SBA recognizes that there are significant differences, across industries, with respect to competitiveness, entry and exit costs, distribution by size, growth rates, and technological change. Although the SBA defines 500 employees as the limit for the majority of industrial firms and receipts of $7 million for the majority of service, retail, and construction firms, there are different values for some industries. <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_t01">Table 1.1 "Examples of Size Limits for Small Businesses by the SBA"</a> presents a selection of different industries and their size limits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p02">The SBA definition of what constitutes a small business has practical significance. Small businesses have access to an extensive support network provided by the SBA. It runs the SCORE program, which has more than 12,000 volunteers who assist small firms with counseling and training. The SBA also operates Small Business Development Centers, Export Assistance Centers, and Women’s Business Centers. These centers provide comprehensive assistance to small firms. There can be significant economic support for small firms from the SBA. It offers a variety of guaranteed loan programs to start-ups and small firms. It assists small firms in acquiring access to nearly half a trillion dollars in federal contracts. In fact, legislation attempts to target 23 percent of this value for small firms. The SBA can also assist with financial aid following a disaster.</p>

It can be seen that in some industries—construction and real estate—80 percent or more of that industry’s contribution to the GDP comes from small businesses, while in the information industry that number is 20 percent or less.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_p02">Few people realize that the overwhelming majority of businesses in the United States are small businesses with fewer than five hundred employees. The SBA puts the number of small businesses at 99.7 percent of the total number of businesses in the United States. However, most of the businesses are nonemployee businesses (i.e., no paid employees) and are home based.</p>

Recent data indicate that small businesses produced 64 percent of the net new jobs from 1993 to the third quarter of 2008.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_019">“Statistics of U.S. Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">US Census Bureau</em>, April 13, 2010, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/econ/susb">www.census.gov/econ/susb</a>.</span> This is not a recent phenomenon. Thirty years of research studies have consistently indicated that the driving force in fostering new job creation is the birth of new companies and the net additions coming from small businesses. In the 1990s, firms with fewer than twenty employees produced far more net jobs proportionally to their size, and two to three times as many jobs were created through new business formation than through job expansion in small businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_020">William J Dennis Jr., Bruce D. Phillips, and Edward Starr, “Small Business Job Creation: The Findings and Their Critics”, <em class="emphasis">Business Economics</em> 29, no. 3 (1994): 23–30.</span> The US Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data confirm that the greatest number of new jobs comes from the creation of new businesses. One can get a sense of the extent of net job change by business size in <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_t02">Table 1.4 "Job Creation by Firm Size"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p03">An additional point needs to be made about job creation and loss by small businesses in the context of overall economic conditions.

In the 2001 recession, small businesses with fewer than 20 employees experienced 7 percent of the total reduction in jobs, firms with between 20 and 500 employees were responsible for 43 percent of the job losses, and the rest of the job losses came from large firms. As the economy recovered in the following year, firms with fewer than 20 employees created jobs, while the other two groups continued to shed jobs. Following the 1991 recession, it was firms with 20 to 500 employees that were responsible for more than 56 percent of the jobs that were added.</p>

The number of African Americans who were self-employed increased by 36.6 percent for the same time range. However, the most remarkable number was an increase of nearly 110 percent for Hispanics.

E. Deming, the quality guru, advocated that business success required “delighting” customers. No one can argue, specifically, with any of these definitions of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">small business success</a><span class="glossdef">The need for independence by small business owners.</span></span>, but they miss an important element of the definition of success for the small business owner: <em class="emphasis">to be free and independent</em>.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p01">When discussing failure rates in small business, there is only one appropriate word: <em class="emphasis">confusion</em>. There are wildly different values, from 90 percent to 1 percent, with a wide range of values in between.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_029">Roger Dickinson, “Business Failure Rate,” <em class="emphasis">American Journal of Small Business</em> 6, no. 2 (1981): 17–25.</span> Obviously, there is a problem with these results, or some factor is missing. One factor that would explain this discrepancy is the different definitions of the term <em class="emphasis">failure</em>. A second factor is that of timeline. When will a firm fail after it starts operation?</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p02">The term <em class="emphasis">failure</em> can have several meanings.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_030">A. B.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_l01">
            <li>An owner can die or simply choose to discontinue operations.</li>
            <li>The owner may recognize that the business is not generating sufficient return to warrant the effort that is being put into it. This is sometimes referred to as the failure of opportunity cost.</li>
            <li>A firm that is losing money may be terminated to avoid losses to its creditors.</li>
            <li>There can be losses to creditors that bring about cessations of the firm’s operations.</li>
            <li>The firm can experience bankruptcy. Bankruptcy is probably what most people think of when they hear the term <em class="emphasis">business failure</em>. However, the evidence indicates that bankruptcies constitute only a minor reason for failure.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_p03">Failure can therefore be thought of in terms of a cascading series of outcomes (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s02_f01">Figure 1.1 "Types of Business Failures"</a>).

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do Small Businesses Fail?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p01">There is no more puzzling or better studied issue in the field of small business than what causes them to fail. Given the critical role of small businesses in the US economy, the economic consequences of failure can be significant. Yet there is no definitive answer to the question.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p02">Three broad categories of causes of failure have been identified: managerial inadequacy, financial inadequacy, and external factors. The first cause, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">managerial inadequacy</a><span class="glossdef">The failure of a firm is based on the limitations of its owner, such as a lack of business skills or a lack of behavior skills.</span></span>, is the most frequently mentioned reason for firm failure.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_036">T. C. Carbone, “The Challenges of Small Business Management,” <em class="emphasis">Management World</em> 9, no. 10 (1980): 36.</span> Unfortunately, it is an all-inclusive explanation, much like explaining that all plane crashes are due to pilot failure. Over thirty years ago, it was observed that “while everyone agrees that bad management is the prime cause of failure, no one agrees what ‘bad management’ means nor how it can be recognized except that the company has collapsed—then everyone agrees that how badly managed it was.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_037">John Argenti, <em class="emphasis">Corporate Collapse: The Causes and Symptoms</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1976), 45.</span> This observation remains true today.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p03">The second most common explanation cites <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">financial inadequacy</a><span class="glossdef">The failure of a firm is based on financial issues, such as having inadequate financing at the beginning, inadequate financial controls, poor cash-flow management, and the inability to raise additional capital.</span></span>, or a lack of financial strength in a firm. A third set of explanations center on environmental or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">external factors</a><span class="glossdef">The failure of the firm is based on external factors, such as a downturn in the economy, rising interest rates, or changes in customer demand.</span></span>, such as a significant decline in the economy.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p04">Because it is important that small firms succeed, not fail, each factor will be discussed in detail. However, these factors are not independent elements distinct from each other. A declining economy will depress a firm’s sales, which negatively affects a firm’s cash flow. An owner who lacks the knowledge and experience to manage this cash flow problem will see his or her firm fail.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p05">Managerial inadequacy is generally perceived as the major cause of small business failure. Unfortunately, this term encompasses a very broad set of issues. It has been estimated that two thirds of small business failures are due to the incompetence of the owner-manager.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_038">Graham Beaver, “Small Business: Success and Failure,” <em class="emphasis">Strategic Change</em> 12, no. 3 (2003): 115–22.</span> The identified problems cover behavioral issues, a lack of business skills, a lack of specific technical skills, and marketing myopia. Specifying every limitation of these owners would be prohibitive. However, some limitations are mentioned with remarkable consistency. Having poor communication skills, with employees and/or customers, appears to be a marker for failure.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_039">Sharon Nelton, “Ten Key Threats to Success,” <em class="emphasis">Nation’s Business</em> 80, no. 6 (1992): 18–24.</span> The inability to listen to criticism or divergent views is a marker for failure, as is the inability to be flexible in one’s thinking.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_040">Robert N. Steck, “Why New Businesses Fail,” <em class="emphasis">Dun and Bradstreet Reports</em> 33, no. 6 (1985): 34–38.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p06">Ask many small business owners where their strategic plans exist, and they may point to their foreheads. The failure to conduct formal planning may be the most frequently mentioned item with respect to small business failure.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p08">The second major cause of small business failure is finance. Financial problems fall into three categories: start-up, cash flow, and financial management. When a firm begins operation (start-up), it will require capital. Unfortunately, many small business owners initially underestimate the amount of capital that should be available for operations.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_053">Howard Upton, “Management Mistakes in a New Business,” <em class="emphasis">National Petroleum News</em> 84, no. 10 (1992): 50.</span> This may explain why most small firms that fail do so within the first few years of their creation. The failure to start with sufficient capital can be attributed to the inability of the owner to acquire the needed capital. It can also be due to the owner’s failure to sufficiently plan for his or her capital needs. Here we see the possible interactions among the major causes of firm failure. Cash-flow management has been identified as a prime cause for failure.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_054">Rubik Atamian and Neal R. VanZante, “Continuing Education: A Vital Ingredient of the ‘Success Plan’ for Business,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business and Economic Research</em> 8, no. 3 (2010): 37–42.</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_055">Arthur R. DeThomas and William B. Fredenberger, “Accounting Needs of Very Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">The CPA Journal</em> 55, no. 10 (1985): 14–20.</span> Good cash-flow management is essential for the survival of any firm, but small firms in particular must pay close attention to this process. Small businesses must develop and maintain effective financial controls, such as credit controls.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_056">Roger Brown, “Keeping Control of Your Credit,” <em class="emphasis">Motor Transportation</em>, April 2009, 8.</span> For very small businesses, this translates into having an owner who has at least a fundamental familiarity with accounting and finance.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_057">Arthur R. DeThomas and William B. Fredenberger, “Accounting Needs of Very Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">The CPA Journal</em> 55, no. 10 (1985): 14–20.</span> In addition, the small firm will need either an in-house or an outsourced accountant.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_058">Hugh M. O’Neill and Jacob Duker, “Survival and Failure in Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Small Business Management</em> 24, no. 1 (1986): 30–37.</span> Unfortunately, many owners fail to fully use their accountants’ advice to manage their businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_059">Arthur R. DeThomas and William B. Fredenberger, “Accounting Needs of Very Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">The CPA Journal</em> 55, no. 10 (1985): 14–20.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p09">The last major factor identified with the failure of small businesses is the external environment. There is a potentially infinite list of causes, but the economic environment tends to be most prominent. Here again, however, <em class="emphasis">confusing</em> appears to describe the list. Some argue that economic conditions contribute to between 30 percent and 50 percent of small business failures, in direct contradiction to the belief that managerial incompetence is the major cause.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_060">Jim Everett and John Watson, “Small Business Failures and External Risk Factors,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Economics</em> 11, no. 4 (1998): 371–90.</span> Two economic measures appear to affect failure rates: interest rates, which appear to be tied to bankruptcies, and the unemployment rate, which appears to be tied to discontinuance.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_061">Jim Everett and John Watson, “Small Business Failures and External Risk Factors,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Economics</em> 11, no. 4 (1998): 371–90.</span> The potential impact of these external economic variables might be that small business owners need to be either planners to cover potential contingencies or lucky.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_p10">Even given the confusing and sometimes conflicting results with respect to failure in small businesses, some common themes can be identified. The reasons for failure fall into three broad categories: managerial inadequacy, finance, and environmental. They, in turn, have some consistently mentioned factors (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch01_s02_s03_t01">Table 1.5 "Reasons for Small Business Failure"</a>). These factors should be viewed as warning signs—danger areas that need to be avoided if you wish to survive. Although small business owners cannot directly affect environmental conditions, they can recognize the potential problems that they might bring. This text will provide guidance on how the small business owner can minimize these threats through proactive leadership.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Understanding the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">small business growth stages</a><span class="glossdef">The five stages that small businesses may go through: existence, survival, success, take-off, and resource maturity.</span></span> can be invaluable as a framework for anticipating resource needs and problems, assessing risk, and formulating business strategies (e.g., evaluating and responding to the impact of a new tax). However, the growth stages will not be applicable to all small businesses because not all small businesses will be looking to grow. Business success is commonly associated with growth and financial performance, but these are not necessarily synonymous—especially for small businesses. People become business owners for different reasons, so judgments about the success of their businesses may be related to any of those reasons.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_064">B.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Stage II: </strong><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Survival</a><span class="glossdef">A business is viable, and the focus shifts to revenues and expenses.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_068">Neil C.

There are enough customers, and they are being satisfied well enough for them to stay with the business. The company’s focal point shifts to the relationship between revenues and expenses. Owners will be concerned with (1) whether they can generate enough cash in the short run to break even and cover the repair/replacement of basic assets and (2) whether they can get enough cash flow to stay in business and finance growth to earn an economic return on assets and labor. The organizational structure remains simple. Little systems development is evident, cash forecasting is the focus of formal planning, and the owner still runs everything.</li>

The first track is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">success-growth substage</a><span class="glossdef">An owner risks all resources in financing growth.</span></span>, where the small business owner pulls all the company resources together and risks them all in financing growth. Systems are installed with forthcoming needs in mind. Operational planning focuses on budgets. Strategic planning is extensive, and the owner is deeply involved. The management style is functional, but the owner is active in all phases of the company’s business. The second track is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">success-disengagement substage</a><span class="glossdef">An owner’s operational duties are assumed by managers. The focus is on maintaining the status quo.</span></span>, where managers take over the owner’s operational duties, and the strategy focuses on maintaining the status quo. Cash is plentiful, so the company should be able to maintain itself indefinitely, barring external environmental changes. The owners benefit indefinitely from the positive cash flow or prepare for a sale or a merger. The first professional managers are hired, and basic financial, marketing, and production systems are in place.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stage IV: </strong><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Take-off</a><span class="glossdef">A business becomes increasingly complex.

Lewis, “The Five Stages of Small Business Growth,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 61, no. 3 (1983): 30–44, 48–50.</span> This is a critical time in a company’s life. The business is becoming increasingly complex. The owners must decide how to grow rapidly and how to finance that growth. There are two key questions: (1) Can the owner delegate responsibility to others to improve managerial effectiveness? (2) Will there be enough cash to satisfy the demands of growth? The organization is decentralized and may have some divisions in place. Both operational planning and strategic planning are being conducted and involve specific managers. If the owner rises to the challenges of growth, it can become a very successful big business. If not, it can usually be sold at a profit.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stage V: </strong><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Resource Maturity</a><span class="glossdef">A business has demonstrated success.

It has the staff and financial resources to engage in detailed operational and strategic planning. The management structure is decentralized, with experienced senior staff, and all necessary systems are in place. The owner and the business have separated both financially and operationally. The concerns at this stage are to (1) consolidate and control the financial gains that have been brought on by the rapid growth and (2) retain the advantage of a small size (e.g., response flexibility and the entrepreneurial spirit). If the entrepreneurial spirit can be maintained, there is a strong probability of continued growth and success. If not, the company may find itself in a state of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ossification</a><span class="glossdef">If innovation is lacking, risk aversion is prevalent, and the entrepreneurial spirit is gone, a business may exhibit stalled or halted growth.</span></span>. This occurs when there is a lack of innovation and risk aversion that, in turn, will contribute to stalled or halted growth. These are common traits in large corporations.</li>

All small businesses compete in an industry, and that industry will experience a life cycle just as products and organizations do. Although there may be overlap in the names of the ILC stages, the meaning and implications of each stage are different.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">industry life cycle</a><span class="glossdef">The life stages that characterize an industry.</span></span> refers to the continuum along which an industry is born, grows, matures, and eventually experiences decline and then dies.

                <li>Small-business management should consider the growth stages, the OLC, and the ILC in its planning.</li>
                <li>There are five stages of small business growth: existence, survival, success, take-off, and resource maturity. The success stage includes two substages, growth and disengagement. Ossification may result if a mature small business loses its entrepreneurial spirit and becomes more risk averse.</li>
                <li>Some small businesses may not be looking to grow, so they may remain in the survival stage.</li>
                <li>The OLC refers to the four stages of development that organizations go through: birth, youth, midlife, and maturity.</li>
                <li>Some small businesses may stick with the very simple organizational structures because they are not interested in growing to the point where more complicated structures are required.</li>
                <li>The ILC is the time continuum along which an industry is born, grows, matures, declines, and dies.</li>
                <li>There are four stages in the ILC: introduction, growth, maturity, and decline.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Ethics are not the same as our feelings.</strong> Our feelings are not always accurate indicators about a particular action being unethical (e.g., taking a long lunch or spending too much personal time on the Internet while at work).

<strong class="emphasis bold">Ethics are not necessarily synonymous with the law.</strong> There will be instances in which ethical behavior and the law are the same (e.g., in the cases of murder, discrimination, whistleblower protection, and fraud).

An estimated 75 percent of employees steal from the workplace, and most do so repeatedly. One third of all US corporate bankruptcies are caused directly by employee theft; US companies lose nearly $400 billion per year in lost productivity due to “time theft” or loafing; and an estimated 20 percent of every dollar earned by a US company is lost to employee theft.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_097">Terrence Shulman, “Employee Theft Statistics,” <em class="emphasis">Employee Theft Solutions</em>, 2007, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.employeetheftsolutions.com">www.employeetheftsolutions.com</a>.</span> Office supplies, money, and merchandise are the most frequently stolen items.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_098">Leslie Taylor, “Four in 10 Managers Have Fired Employees for Theft,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, September 1, 2006, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/news/articles/200609/theft.html?partner=rss">www.inc.com/news/articles/200609/theft.html?partner=rss</a>.</span> Employee theft may be even more of a concern to small businesses because many small businesses operate so close to the margin.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01">In business, it is common for there to be conflicts between business success and ethical behavior. When faced with an ethical dilemma, the decision may be unduly influenced by profits and legality. This challenge is particularly acute for small business owners because they are so much closer to the employees and the customers. The results of ethical decisions will be felt more immediately by the entire company.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_100">Karen E.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p02">Small-business owners will find themselves confronted more often with ethical choices because of the decision-making autonomy that they have; there is no need to answer to a large number of employees, corporate management, or a corporate board. The ethical choices that are made will likely impact a far greater number of people than will the ethical decisions of individual employees. Many business decisions will pose ethical challenges—examples being whether to use inferior materials to produce products because of competition with larger businesses, employee and workplace problems, product quality and pricing, legal problems, and government regulatory concerns.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_101">Jeffrey S.

It is more difficult for the small business owner to be unethical. Ultimately, small business owners will behave in accordance with “their own moral compass, sense of fair play and inclination to deal in good faith.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_103">Jim Blasingame, “Small Business Ethics,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Advocate</em>, August 13, 2001, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessadvocate.com/motivational-minutes/small-business-ethics-22">www.smallbusinessadvocate.com/motivational-minutes/small-business-ethics-22</a>.</span></p>

King, “Small Business Ethics: Influences and Perceptions,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Small Business Management</em> 11, no. 8 (1982): 11–18.</span> small businesses see norms and pressures from the community and peers as having more influence on their ethics than moral or religious principles, the anticipation of rewards, upholding the law, or the fear of punishment. This leads to the conclusion that small business is influenced significantly by the communities in which their businesses are located. Socially responsive behavior is visible and it is “rewarded or sanctioned by local residents through changes in employee morale, performance, and turnover; customer loyalty; and positive interactions with business service professionals, suppliers, local government officials, and business colleagues. These local sanctioning mechanisms [in turn affected] the success of the business.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_105">Terry L.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p04">Because of this community influence, customer relationships are and must be based on trust and the relatively immediate visibility of ethical behavior.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Include employees in developing a code of ethics.</strong> A mandate from the small business owner will not be effective. Get input from your employees whenever possible. They will be more accepting of the ethics policy.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Train your people to be ethical.</strong> The extent and nature of employee education and training will depend on the size of the small business. Even the smallest business, however, will benefit from some ethics training.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Post your code of ethics internally and set up a reporting system.</strong> Employees need a way to let someone know about ethics violations. Both an open-door policy and an anonymous reporting system will be helpful.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consider appointing a compliance person.</strong> This would probably not be appropriate for the very small businesses. However, it would be worth considering if the business has fifty or more employees. Having someone to whom employees can report suspected ethical problems would make things much simpler.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Follow up on any ethics violations you uncover.</strong> Make sure that everyone understands the ramifications of ethics policy violations. Include an appeals process.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Live it from the top down.</strong> The small business owner must walk the talk. No one should appear to be above the code of ethics. Good role modeling is critical.</li>

                <li>Ethics are about doing the right thing. They are about standards that help us decide between right and wrong. They are not the same as our feelings, religion, the law, cultural norms, science, or values.</li>
                <li>Ethics are important because they provide structure and stabilization for society.</li>
                <li>Business ethics are about applying the virtues and discipline of ethics to business behavior. They set the standard for how your business is conducted and define the value system of how you operate in the marketplace and within your business.</li>
                <li>Companies that “outbehave” the competition ethically tend to outperform them financially.</li>
                <li>Ethical behavior in business improves the workplace climate and will ultimately improve the bottom line. The cost of unethical behavior can be staggering.</li>
                <li>Small-business owners have the opportunity to set the ethical tone for their companies. Modeling ethical behavior is key. The community and peers heavily influence small business ethics.</li>
                <li>Establishing an ethics policy is critical for creating an ethical work environment. The contents of the policy should be specific to the values, goals, and culture of each company. One size does not fit all.</li>

                <li>MaryAnn’s marketing team just presented a “Less Sugar” ad campaign to the cereal brand manager for three of her brands. The packages shouted “75% LESS SUGAR” in large and colorful type so that it would catch the parent’s eye and increase sales. With all the recent attention about childhood obesity, the company thought that parents would purchase the cereal to help their children attain and keep a healthy weight. A side-by-side comparison of the less-sugar and the high-sugar versions of the cereals, however, revealed that the carbohydrate content of the cereals was essentially the same. At best, the less-sugar version had only ten fewer calories per bowl. It offered no weight-loss advantage.

You told her that it would be important to involve the employees in the development of the code, but you committed to do two things for her in preparation for that involvement: (1) search the Internet for a code of ethics that could be tailored to her needs and (2) prepare a preliminary list of topics that should be included in the code. She thanked you and asked that you submit your ideas within the week. She reminded you that her business is small, so a code of ethics for a large corporation would not be suitable.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Value</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">In 1916, Nathan Hanwerker was an employee at one of the largest restaurants on Coney Island—but he had a vision. Using his wife’s recipe, he and his wife opened a hot dog stand. He believed that the combination of a better tasting hot dog and the nickel price, half that of his competitors, was his recipe for success. He was wrong. Unfortunately for Nathan, Upton Sinclair’s book <em class="emphasis">The Jungle</em> a decade before had made the public suspicious of low-cost meat products. Nathan discovered that his initial business model was not working. Customers valued taste and cost, but they also valued the quality of a safe product. To convince customers that his hot dogs were safe, he secured several doctors’ smocks and had people wear them. The sight of “doctors” consuming Nathan’s hot dogs gave customers the extra value that they needed. It was all about the perception of quality. If doctors were eating the hot dogs, they must be OK. Today there are over 20,000 outlets serving Nathan’s hot dogs.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_115">John A. Jakle and Keith A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p03">In reality, the creation of customer value will always be a challenge—particularly because it almost always needs to be defined on the customer’s terms.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_117">H. Whitelock, “How to Create Customer Value,” <em class="emphasis">eZine Articles</em>, March 16, 2007, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Create-Customer-Value%20&amp;id=491697">ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Create-Customer-Value &amp;id=491697</a>.</span> Nonetheless, “the number one goal of business should be to ‘maximize customer value and strive to increase value continuously.’ If a firm maximizes customer value, relative to competitors, success will follow.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p04">The small business owner needs to be thinking about customer value every day: what is offered now, how it can be made better, and what the competition is doing that is offering more value. It is not easy, but it is essential. All business decisions will add to or detract from the value that can be offered to the customer. If your product or service is perceived to offer more value than that of the competition, you will get the sale. Otherwise, you will not get the sale.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p02">Most people would define success with respect to profits or sales. This misses a critical point. The survival of a firm hinges not so much on sales or profits, although these are vitally important, as it does on the firm’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A firm must learn to properly manage its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cash flow</a><span class="glossdef">The money coming into and exiting a business.</span></span>, defined as the money coming into and flowing from a business because cash is more than king. <em class="emphasis">It is a firm’s lifeblood.</em> As the North Dakota Small Business Development Center put it, “Failure to properly plan cash flow is one of the leading causes for small business failure.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_119">“Why Is Cash Flow So Important<em class="emphasis">?,” North Dakota Small Business Development Center</em>, 2005, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ndsbdc.org/faq/default.asp?ID=323">www.ndsbdc.org/faq/default.asp?ID=323</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p03">An understanding of cash flow requires some understanding of accounting systems. There are two types: cash based and accrual. In a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cash-based accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Sales are recorded when the money is received.</span></span> system, sales are recorded when you receive the money. This type of system is really meant for small firms with sales totaling less than $1 million. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Accrual accounting</a><span class="glossdef">The focus is on measuring profits.</span></span> systems, by contrast, are systems that focus on measuring profits. They assume that when you make a sale, you are paid at that point. However, almost all firms make sales on credit, and they also make purchases on credit. Add in that sales are seldom constant, and you begin to see how easily and often cash inflows and outflows can fall out of sync. This can reduce a firm’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">liquidity</a><span class="glossdef">The ability of a small business to pay its bills.</span></span>, which is its ability to pay its bills. Envision the following scenario: A firm generates tremendous sales by using easy credit terms: 10 percent down and one year to pay the remaining 90 percent. However, the firm purchases its materials under tight credit terms. In an accrual accounting system, this might appear to produce significant profits. However, the firm may be unable to pay its bills and salaries. In this type of situation, the firm, particularly the small firm, can easily fail.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p04">There are other reasons why cash flow is critically important. Firms need to have the money to buy new materials or expand. In addition, firms should have cash available to meet unexpected contingencies or investment opportunities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cash-flow management</a><span class="glossdef">Expense control, receivables management, inventory control, and developing a close relationship with commercial lenders.</span></span> requires a future-focused orientation. You have to anticipate your future cash inflows and outflows and what actions you may need to take to preserve your liquidity. Today, even the nonemployee firm can begin this process with simple spreadsheet software. Slightly larger firms could opt for the user-dedicated software. In either case, cash-flow analysis requires the owner to focus on the future and to develop effective planning skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p06">Cash-flow management also involves activities such as expense control, receivables management, inventory control, and developing a close relationship with commercial lenders. The small business owner needs to think about these things every day. Their requirements may tax many small business operators, but they are essential skills.</p>

It would be impossible to list all the types of software that can enhance small business operations, so the focus will be on the major types of aids.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_s01_p02">Today, even the smallest of firms can acquire a complete accounting system at a reasonable price.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_s01_p03">Small-business operations have also benefited greatly from affordable software that can handle forecasting, inventory control and purchasing, customer relations, and shipping and receiving.
