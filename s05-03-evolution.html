One thing that they all share, however, is experience with common problems that arise at similar stages in their growth and organizational evolution. Predictable patterns can be seen. These patterns “tend to be sequential, occur as a hierarchical progression that is not easily reversed, and involve a broad range of organizational activities and structures.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_063">“Organizational Life Cycle,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, 2010, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/organizational-life-cycle.html">www.inc.com/encyclopedia/organizational-life-cycle.html</a>.</span> The industry life cycle adds further complications. The success of any small business will depend on its ability to adapt to evolutionary changes, each of which will be characterized by different requirements, opportunities, challenges, risks, and internal and external threats. The decisions that need to be made and the priorities that are established will differ through this evolution.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s03_s01_p01">Understanding the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">small business growth stages</a><span class="glossdef">The five stages that small businesses may go through: existence, survival, success, take-off, and resource maturity.</span></span> can be invaluable as a framework for anticipating resource needs and problems, assessing risk, and formulating business strategies (e.g., evaluating and responding to the impact of a new tax). However, the growth stages will not be applicable to all small businesses because not all small businesses will be looking to grow. Business success is commonly associated with growth and financial performance, but these are not necessarily synonymous—especially for small businesses. People become business owners for different reasons, so judgments about the success of their businesses may be related to any of those reasons.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_064">B.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Stage II: </strong><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Survival</a><span class="glossdef">A business is viable, and the focus shifts to revenues and expenses.</span></span>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_068">Neil C.

There are enough customers, and they are being satisfied well enough for them to stay with the business. The company’s focal point shifts to the relationship between revenues and expenses. Owners will be concerned with (1) whether they can generate enough cash in the short run to break even and cover the repair/replacement of basic assets and (2) whether they can get enough cash flow to stay in business and finance growth to earn an economic return on assets and labor. The organizational structure remains simple. Little systems development is evident, cash forecasting is the focus of formal planning, and the owner still runs everything.</li>

The first track is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">success-growth substage</a><span class="glossdef">An owner risks all resources in financing growth.</span></span>, where the small business owner pulls all the company resources together and risks them all in financing growth. Systems are installed with forthcoming needs in mind. Operational planning focuses on budgets. Strategic planning is extensive, and the owner is deeply involved. The management style is functional, but the owner is active in all phases of the company’s business. The second track is the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">success-disengagement substage</a><span class="glossdef">An owner’s operational duties are assumed by managers. The focus is on maintaining the status quo.</span></span>, where managers take over the owner’s operational duties, and the strategy focuses on maintaining the status quo. Cash is plentiful, so the company should be able to maintain itself indefinitely, barring external environmental changes. The owners benefit indefinitely from the positive cash flow or prepare for a sale or a merger. The first professional managers are hired, and basic financial, marketing, and production systems are in place.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stage IV: </strong><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Take-off</a><span class="glossdef">A business becomes increasingly complex.

Lewis, “The Five Stages of Small Business Growth,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em> 61, no. 3 (1983): 30–44, 48–50.</span> This is a critical time in a company’s life. The business is becoming increasingly complex. The owners must decide how to grow rapidly and how to finance that growth. There are two key questions: (1) Can the owner delegate responsibility to others to improve managerial effectiveness? (2) Will there be enough cash to satisfy the demands of growth? The organization is decentralized and may have some divisions in place. Both operational planning and strategic planning are being conducted and involve specific managers. If the owner rises to the challenges of growth, it can become a very successful big business. If not, it can usually be sold at a profit.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stage V: </strong><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Resource Maturity</a><span class="glossdef">A business has demonstrated success.

It has the staff and financial resources to engage in detailed operational and strategic planning. The management structure is decentralized, with experienced senior staff, and all necessary systems are in place. The owner and the business have separated both financially and operationally. The concerns at this stage are to (1) consolidate and control the financial gains that have been brought on by the rapid growth and (2) retain the advantage of a small size (e.g., response flexibility and the entrepreneurial spirit). If the entrepreneurial spirit can be maintained, there is a strong probability of continued growth and success. If not, the company may find itself in a state of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ossification</a><span class="glossdef">If innovation is lacking, risk aversion is prevalent, and the entrepreneurial spirit is gone, a business may exhibit stalled or halted growth.</span></span>. This occurs when there is a lack of innovation and risk aversion that, in turn, will contribute to stalled or halted growth. These are common traits in large corporations.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p01">The industry life cycle (ILC) is another dimension of small business evolution, which needs to be understood and assessed in concert with the stages of small business growth and the OLC. All small businesses compete in an industry, and that industry will experience a life cycle just as products and organizations do. Although there may be overlap in the names of the ILC stages, the meaning and implications of each stage are different.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s03_s03_p02">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">industry life cycle</a><span class="glossdef">The life stages that characterize an industry.</span></span> refers to the continuum along which an industry is born, grows, matures, and eventually experiences decline and then dies. Although the pattern is predictable, the duration of each stage in the cycle is not. The stages are the same for all industries, but every industry will experience the stages differently. The stages will last longer for some and pass quickly for others; even within the same industry various small businesses may find themselves at different life cycle stages.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_080">“Industry Life Cycle,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, 2010, accessed June 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/industry-life-cycle.html">www.inc.com/encyclopedia/industry-life-cycle.html</a>.</span> However, no matter where a small business finds itself along the ILC continuum, the strategic planning of that business will be influenced in important ways.</p>

Although it is possible for a small business to be alone in the industry as a result of having developed and introduced something new to the marketplace, this is not the usual situation. The business strategy will focus on stressing the uniqueness of the product or the service to a small group of customers, commonly referred to as innovators or early adopters. A significant amount of capital is required. Profits are usually negative for both the firm and the industry.</p>

This stage also requires a significant amount of capital, but increasing product standardization may lead to economies of scale that will, in turn, increase profitability. The strategic focus is product differentiation, with an increased focus on responding to customer needs and interests. Intense competition will result as more new competitors join the industry, but many firms will be profitable. The duration of the growth stage will be industry dependent.</p>

This means that the marketing effort must continue to focus on product or service differentiation.

It is typically triggered by a product or service innovation that renders the industry obsolete. Sales will suffer, and the business goes into decline. Some companies will leave the industry, but others will remain to compete in the smaller market. The smaller businesses may be more agile for competing in a declining industry, but they will need to carefully formulate their business strategies to remain viable.</p>

                <li>Small-business management should consider the growth stages, the OLC, and the ILC in its planning.</li>
                <li>There are five stages of small business growth: existence, survival, success, take-off, and resource maturity. The success stage includes two substages, growth and disengagement.

                <li>The OLC refers to the four stages of development that organizations go through: birth, youth, midlife, and maturity.</li>
                <li>Some small businesses may stick with the very simple organizational structures because they are not interested in growing to the point where more complicated structures are required.</li>
                <li>The ILC is the time continuum along which an industry is born, grows, matures, declines, and dies.</li>
