        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s01_p02">The ultimate cost for a website will be a function of its size, complexity, and the level of design. No two projects will cost the same. Part of the process of building a website, however, should be conducting some research and talking with website designers. The Internet offers a variety of sources on how to determine how much a website should cost. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.WebpageFX.com">WebpageFX.com</a> offers a historical perspective on website costs, a cost calculator to find out how much a web project would cost, and examples of specific web design and website development projects with cost figures.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_051">“How Much Should a Web Site Cost?,” 2010, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.webpagefx.com/How-much-should-web-site-cost.html">www.webpagefx.com/How-much-should-web-site-cost.html</a>.</span></p>

            <li>“A small business needs a website for their business so they have a presence on the Internet. The site is simple—about 5 pages with information about the business, the services they provide, and a form that can be submitted and the information received via email. The budget isn’t available for creating a graphic ‘look,’ and existing images will be used. A smaller, less experienced designer may take on a project like this for a few hundred dollars. A medium sized firm might quote $3000 to $4000 depending on variables. A larger firm would probably not take a project this small.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_052">“How Much Does a Website Cost?,” <em class="emphasis">Planetlink.com</em>, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.planetlink.com/articles/how_much_does_website_cost.html">www.planetlink.com/articles/how_much_does_website_cost.html</a>.</span>

            <li>“A mail order company wants to get into online sales. They currently have no website.

            <li>If using a contract with another party, make sure the contract says that any dispute must be filed in your home state and that both parties to the contract agree to jurisdiction in that state.</li>
            <li>When a customer is purchasing an item on the website of a business, one of the terms and conditions of the transaction should be that the customer agree to jurisdiction in the home state of that business.

However, the laws in other countries will undoubtedly introduce complications into protecting the US-based business. Take the example of Yahoo! and the sale of Nazi memorabilia on one of its auction websites. A French court ruled that such sales breached French law against the display of Nazi items. Yahoo! took steps to remove and ban all such hate paraphernalia from its auction sites, but it continued to fight jurisdiction of the French ruling in American courts.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_064">Kathleen Mykytn and Peter Mykytn, “The Importance of the Law For E-Commerce Strategies,” <em class="emphasis">Information Systems Management</em> 22, no. 2 (2005): 50–56.</span> It would be very easy for a small business to inadvertently find itself in a similar situation.

Physical cues from spaces and buildings, face-to-face voice and body language, and salesperson effectiveness can translate easily into trust relationships. In the online world, however, trust develops as a result of the complex interaction of multiple factors that have design implications for the website. Here are some examples of trust:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_084">Avshalom Adam, Avshalom Aderet, and Arik Sadeh, “Do Ethics Matter to E-Consumers?,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Internet Commerce</em> 6, no. 2 (2007): 19–34; Andrea Everard and Dennis F.

Additional payment methods should be added as quickly as the budget allows because it is clear that more payment options translate into a greater likelihood of purchase. However, the choice of alternative payment methods should be in keeping with the growth strategy of the business. It may be that offering one method of payment provides a satisfactory level of sales, thereby eliminating the need for additional methods for sales growth.</p>
