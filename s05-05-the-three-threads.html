    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_p01">There are three threads that flow throughout this text: customer value, cash flow, and digital resources and e-environments. These threads can be likened to the human body. Cash flow is the circulatory system, without which there can be no life. Digital technology and e-business are the internal organs that carry out daily processes. E-commerce is the sensory system that enables business to observe and interact with the external environment. Customer value is overall health. These threads must figure prominently in all small business decision making. Although they are necessary but not sufficient conditions for small business survival, the chances for survival will be reduced significantly if they are not used.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Value</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p01">In 1916, Nathan Hanwerker was an employee at one of the largest restaurants on Coney Island—but he had a vision. Using his wife’s recipe, he and his wife opened a hot dog stand. He believed that the combination of a better tasting hot dog and the nickel price, half that of his competitors, was his recipe for success. He was wrong. Unfortunately for Nathan, Upton Sinclair’s book <em class="emphasis">The Jungle</em> a decade before had made the public suspicious of low-cost meat products. Nathan discovered that his initial business model was not working. Customers valued taste and cost, but they also valued the quality of a safe product. To convince customers that his hot dogs were safe, he secured several doctors’ smocks and had people wear them. The sight of “doctors” consuming Nathan’s hot dogs gave customers the extra value that they needed. It was all about the perception of quality. If doctors were eating the hot dogs, they must be OK. Today there are over 20,000 outlets serving Nathan’s hot dogs.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_115">John A. Jakle and Keith A. Sculle, <em class="emphasis">Fast Food</em> (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins University Press, 1999), 163–64.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p02">In principle, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer value</a><span class="glossdef">The difference between the benefits a customer receives from a product or a service and the costs associated with obtaining the product or the service.</span></span> is a very simple concept. It is the difference between the benefits that a customer receives from a product or a service and the costs associated with obtaining that product or service. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Total customer benefit</a><span class="glossdef">The perceived monetary value of economic, functional, and psychological benefits customers expect from a product or a service because of the products, services, personnel, and images involved.</span></span> refers to the perceived monetary value of the bundle of economic, functional, and psychological benefits customers expect from a product or a service because of the products, services, personnel, and images involved. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Total customer cost</a><span class="glossdef">The perceived bundle of costs customers expect to incur when they evaluate, obtain, use, and dispose of the product or the service.</span></span>, the perceived bundle of costs that customers expect to occur when they evaluate, obtain, use, and dispose of the product or use the service, include monetary, time, energy, and psychological costs.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_116">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice-Hall, 2009), 121.</span> In short, it is all about what customers get and what they have to give up.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p03">In reality, the creation of customer value will always be a challenge—particularly because it almost always needs to be defined on the customer’s terms.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_117">H. Whitelock, “How to Create Customer Value,” <em class="emphasis">eZine Articles</em>, March 16, 2007, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Create-Customer-Value%20&amp;id=491697">ezinearticles.com/?How-to-Create-Customer-Value &amp;id=491697</a>.</span> Nonetheless, “the number one goal of business should be to ‘maximize customer value and strive to increase value continuously.’ If a firm maximizes customer value, relative to competitors, success will follow. If a firm’s products are viewed as conveying little customer value, the firm will eventually atrophy and fail.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_118">Earl Nauman, <em class="emphasis">Creating Customer Value: The Path to Sustainable Competitive Advantage</em> (New York: Free Press, 1995), 16.</span> This will certainly be true for the small business that is much closer to its customers than the large business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s01_p04">The small business owner needs to be thinking about customer value every day: what is offered now, how it can be made better, and what the competition is doing that is offering more value. It is not easy, but it is essential. All business decisions will add to or detract from the value that can be offered to the customer. If your product or service is perceived to offer more value than that of the competition, you will get the sale. Otherwise, you will not get the sale.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash Flow</h2>
        <div class="epigraph block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_ep01">
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p01">Revenue is vanity…margin is sanity…cash is king.</p>
            <p class="attribution">Unknown.</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p02">Most people would define success with respect to profits or sales. This misses a critical point. The survival of a firm hinges not so much on sales or profits, although these are vitally important, as it does on the firm’s ability to meet its financial obligations. A firm must learn to properly manage its <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cash flow</a><span class="glossdef">The money coming into and exiting a business.</span></span>, defined as the money coming into and flowing from a business because cash is more than king. <em class="emphasis">It is a firm’s lifeblood.</em> As the North Dakota Small Business Development Center put it, “Failure to properly plan cash flow is one of the leading causes for small business failure.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_119">“Why Is Cash Flow So Important<em class="emphasis">?,” North Dakota Small Business Development Center</em>, 2005, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ndsbdc.org/faq/default.asp?ID=323">www.ndsbdc.org/faq/default.asp?ID=323</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p03">An understanding of cash flow requires some understanding of accounting systems. There are two types: cash based and accrual. In a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cash-based accounting</a><span class="glossdef">Sales are recorded when the money is received.</span></span> system, sales are recorded when you receive the money. This type of system is really meant for small firms with sales totaling less than $1 million. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Accrual accounting</a><span class="glossdef">The focus is on measuring profits.</span></span> systems, by contrast, are systems that focus on measuring profits. They assume that when you make a sale, you are paid at that point. However, almost all firms make sales on credit, and they also make purchases on credit. Add in that sales are seldom constant, and you begin to see how easily and often cash inflows and outflows can fall out of sync. This can reduce a firm’s <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">liquidity</a><span class="glossdef">The ability of a small business to pay its bills.</span></span>, which is its ability to pay its bills. Envision the following scenario: A firm generates tremendous sales by using easy credit terms: 10 percent down and one year to pay the remaining 90 percent. However, the firm purchases its materials under tight credit terms. In an accrual accounting system, this might appear to produce significant profits. However, the firm may be unable to pay its bills and salaries. In this type of situation, the firm, particularly the small firm, can easily fail.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p04">There are other reasons why cash flow is critically important. Firms need to have the money to buy new materials or expand. In addition, firms should have cash available to meet unexpected contingencies or investment opportunities.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p05"><span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Cash-flow management</a><span class="glossdef">Expense control, receivables management, inventory control, and developing a close relationship with commercial lenders.</span></span> requires a future-focused orientation. You have to anticipate your future cash inflows and outflows and what actions you may need to take to preserve your liquidity. Today, even the nonemployee firm can begin this process with simple spreadsheet software. Slightly larger firms could opt for the user-dedicated software. In either case, cash-flow analysis requires the owner to focus on the future and to develop effective planning skills.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p06">Cash-flow management also involves activities such as expense control, receivables management, inventory control, and developing a close relationship with commercial lenders. The small business owner needs to think about these things every day. Their requirements may tax many small business operators, but they are essential skills.</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_l01">

<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Receivables management</a><span class="glossdef">Trying to receive customer payments as quickly as possible.</span></span> forces owners to think about how to walk the delicate balance of offering customers the benefits of credit while trying to receive the payments as quickly as possible.

Lean inventory management inevitably leads its practitioners to adopt a new process-driven view of the firm and its operations.</li>
            <li>Lastly, attention to cash-flow management recognizes that there may well be periods when cash outflows will exceed cash inflows. You may have to use commercial loans, <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">equity loans</a><span class="glossdef">Pledging physical assets for cash.</span></span> (pledging physical assets for cash), and/or lines of credit. These may not be offered by a lender at the drop of a hat.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s02_p07">A small business needs to be profitable over the long term if it is going to survive.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_s01_p01">With the advent of the personal computer and the Internet, small firms may be able to compete on a more equal footing with larger firms through their intelligent use of digital technologies. It would be impossible to list all the types of software that can enhance small business operations, so the focus will be on the major types of aids.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_s01_p02">Today, even the smallest of firms can acquire a complete accounting system at a reasonable price. These packages can be tailored for specific industries and are designed to grow with the company. They not only generate standard accounting and financial reports but also assist with management decision making. Information about accounting software for small businesses is easily available on the Internet.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_s01_p03">Small-business operations have also benefited greatly from affordable software that can handle forecasting, inventory control and purchasing, customer relations, and shipping and receiving. In fact, the software has advanced to the point where a small firm can cost-effectively possess its own <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">enterprise resource planning (ERP)</a><span class="glossdef">A system that integrates multiple business functions from purchasing to sales, billings, accounting records, and payroll.</span></span> system.

Given the speed of digital technology development, this analysis is something that should be conducted on a frequent basis. It is in the best interest of every small business to introduce digital technologies into the business as quickly as is practical and affordable. There should always be an interest in doing things better and faster.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s05_s03_s02_p02">E-business processes should be introduced wherever there is a process that is currently working OK but is costing unnecessary time and money to implement via paper. This would certainly apply to the small business that finds itself drowning in paperwork. Small businesses should always consider that e-business processes could improve their operational and cost efficiencies overall, so thinking about e-business implications should be part of many decisions. E-business can work for any small business “because it involves the whole business cycle for production, procurement, distribution, sales, payment, fulfillment, restocking and marketing. It’s about relationships with customers, employees, suppliers and distributors. It involves support services like banks, lawyers, accountants and government agencies.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_131">“Making Money on the Internet,” <em class="emphasis">BizBeginners.biz</em>, accessed October 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://bizbeginners.biz/e_business.html">bizbeginners.biz/e_business.html</a>.</span> The way you do business and your future profitability will be affected by e-business. Converting your current business into e-business may require some redesign and reshaping, depending on the size of your company.
