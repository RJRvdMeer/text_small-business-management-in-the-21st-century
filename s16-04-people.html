This term is more appropriate for large bureaucratic organizations that tend to view their personnel as a problem to be managed.

The scope of this planning will be very limited when a business is very small, but as a business grows, it will take on much greater importance. Doing things right with the first new hire will establish a strong foundation for hiring in the future. Forecasting needs for new people, both current and future, is part of workforce planning. No forecast is perfect, but it will provide a basis on which to make hiring decisions.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p01">Because hiring a new employee is an expensive process, it is important to choose sources that have the greatest potential for reaching the people who will most likely be interested in what a small business has to offer. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to know what those sources are, so selecting a mix of sources makes good sense.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Internet.</strong> The Internet offers a wealth of places to advertise a job opportunity. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.monster.com">Monster.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.careerbuilder.com">CareerBuilder.com</a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn.com</a> are among the largest and most well-known sites, but there may be local or regional job sites that might work better, particularly if a business is very small. A business will not have the resources to bring people in from great distances. If a business has a Facebook or a Twitter presence, this is another great place to let people know about job openings. There may also be websites that specialize in particular occupations.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Schools and colleges.</strong> Depending on the nature of the job, local schools and colleges are great sources for job candidates, particularly if the job is part time. Full-time opportunities may be perfect for the new high school or college graduate. It would be worth checking out college alumni offices as well because they often offer job services.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employee referrals.</strong> Referrals are always worth consideration, if only on a preliminary basis. The employee making the referral knows the business and the person being referred. Going this route can significantly shorten the search process…if there is a fit.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promotion from within.</strong> Promoting from within is a time-honored practice. The owner sends a positive signal to employees that there is room for advancement and management cares about its employees. It is significantly less costly and quicker than recruiting outside, candidates are easier to assess because more information is available, and it improves morale and organization loyalty.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_126">“When Is It Better to Promote from Within Your Company?,” <em class="emphasis">AllBusiness</em>, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce-management-hiring-recruitment/1502-1.html">www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce -management-hiring-recruitment/1502-1.html</a>.</span> On the downside, there may be problems between the person who is promoted and former coworkers, and the organization will not benefit from the fresh ideas of someone hired from the outside.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Want ads.</strong> Want ads can be very effective for a small business, especially if a business is looking locally or regionally. The more dynamic the want ad, the more likely it will attract good candidates. Newspapers and local-reach magazines might be a business’s first thoughts but also consider advertising in the newsletters of relevant professional organizations and at the career services offices of local colleges, universities, and technical colleges.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p01">All small businesses want their employees to work better and smarter. In fact, the smaller a business is, the more efficient and effective it must be. Productivity is an issue in two places: the office and in manufacturing. Office productivity (which applies to all levels in the organization) is discussed in this section, and the role of technology is the focus. “Office” is used broadly to include, for example, physical offices, virtual offices, work situations that involve in-the-car time (e.g., realtors and salespeople), restaurant kitchens, and people who work on the sales floor in retail establishments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p02">Even the smallest of businesses can improve productivity by using technology, even though such use may be very limited in some instances. For example, goods and services needed to run a business can often be ordered online; e-mail can be used for customer and supplier communication; taxes can be filed online; and a simple software package like <em class="emphasis">Microsoft Communicator</em> allows intra- and extracompany communication via e-mail, text, and video. It will be the rare business that uses no technology.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p03">Some have referred to technology as the road map to small business success—helping grow the business, work smarter, attract more customers, enhance customer service, and stay ahead of the competition.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_183">“Technology: Your Roadmap to Small-Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">Intel</em>, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/world-ahead/world-ahead-small-business-success-article.html">www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/world-ahead/world-ahead-small -business-success-article.html</a>.</span> An important component of all this is high office productivity.
