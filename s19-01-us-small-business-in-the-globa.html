    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_p01">Although small businesses make up a disproportionately large share of the number of companies that export and import, this represents only about 1 percent of the total number of small businesses. Thus many small businesses have yet to compete globally. The opportunities are there. “So much of what America makes is in great demand,” said US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke in an interview, adding further that the growth potential for small companies is outside the United States. Dale Hayes, vice president of US marketing for UPS concurs, observing that the demand for high-quality American products is huge.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_002">Paul Davidson, “Small Businesses Look Across Borders to Add Markets,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, April 12, 2011, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-04-06-small-businesses-go-international.htm">www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-04-06-small-businesses-go-international.htm</a>; Rieva Lesonsky, “Increased Opportunities for Small-Business Exports,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, June 27, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/opportunities-small-business-exports.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/opportunities-small-business -exports.html</a>.</span> It may be that a small business is already competing globally because foreign-owned companies are competing in our own backyards.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_003">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_p02">Yet the global marketplace is not relevant to most small businesses. Given that 99 percent of the small businesses in the United States are not operating globally—preferring to grow (if they want to) locally, regionally, and perhaps nationally—it is reasonable to conclude that going global will interest only a few. Those few, however, must undertake careful analyses before jumping into the global arena.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p01">It may seem to many that the global market is the domain of the large corporations, but the statistics tell a very different story.

            <li>Nearly 100 percent (99.2 percent) of exporting wholesalers were small businesses, which is 61.1 percent of the sector’s $218 billion in exports.</li>
            <li>Of other companies with exports, 96.9 percent were small businesses.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p02">This tells us that small businesses are very active in the global marketplace, and small business success in international markets is extremely important to the welfare of the United States.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_006">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span> Although it is true that small businesses are major users of imported goods, the focus of this chapter is on small business exporting because exporting can be an effective way to diversify the customer base, manage market fluctuations, grow, and become more competitive.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_007">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p03">Small businesses are limited in the products and the services that they export. Small business exports are concentrated in four main product categories: computers and electronic products, chemicals, machinery, and transportation equipment. However, the leading product categories in terms of market share were wood products, apparel and accessories, tobacco products, beverages, and leather products.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_008">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p04">Although the United States is one of the world’s largest participants in global services trade, very little information exists with respect to services exports by small businesses. What is known is that it is increasingly common for most US services firms to establish a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">foreign affiliate</a><span class="glossdef">A branch or a subsidiary of the parent company established outside the national boundaries of the parent company’s home market.</span></span>—a branch or a subsidiary of the parent company established outside the national boundaries of the parent company’s home market—because most services are better supplied in close proximity to the principal or final customers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_009">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span> Additionally, in some business sectors, foreign regulations may restrict the delivery of some services to affiliates only. For example, to comply with domestic solvency requirements, some countries require that personal lines of insurance be carried out only by affiliates. Another example is the protection of intellectual property rights. This is often accomplished through the services of affiliates, thus intellectual property is kept in-house.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_010">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p05">What is particularly interesting is that most of the service exporting occurs in businesses with 0–19 employees, with the least service exporting done by small businesses with 300–499 employees. This may be the exact opposite of what you would expect.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_p04">Small businesses also face some resource constraints that reduce their ability to export. For example, small businesses are more likely than larger firms to face scarcities of financial and human resources that limit their ability to take advantage of global opportunities. Limited personnel, the inability to meet quality standards, the lack of financial backing, and insufficient knowledge of foreign markets are important constraints affecting the ability of small businesses to export.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_027">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span> Fortunately, being proactive, innovative, and willing to take risks have helped small businesses overcome export impediments and improve export performance.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_028">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s03_p05">The disadvantages of going global may warrant a go-slow approach, but they should not be viewed as knockout factors. If a business’s financial situation is weak, the timing may not be right for becoming an exporter…but perhaps exporting makes sense in the future. In any case, very careful thinking should precede the decision to export.</p>
