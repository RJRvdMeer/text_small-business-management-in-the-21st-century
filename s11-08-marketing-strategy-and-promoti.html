<strong class="emphasis bold">Entice reluctant customers.</strong> Giving away a free product or service is usually a good way to get people to try a product or a service for the first time, the hope being that it will lead to a purchase.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p01">A small business owner needs to connect with customers before a sale can take place. Sometimes personal selling is the best way to do that. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Personal selling</a><span class="glossdef">The process of communicating with a potential buyer (or buyers) face-to-face with the purpose of selling a product or a service.</span></span>, “the process of communicating with a potential buyer (or buyers) face-to-face with the purpose of selling a product or service,”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_220">“Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">eNotes</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.enotes.com/personal-selling-reference/personal-selling-178681">www.enotes.com/personal-selling-reference/personal-selling-178681</a>.</span> is absolutely essential in the marketing communications mix of a small business. History has shown that the most successful entrepreneurs have been skilled salespeople who were able to represent and promote their companies and products in the marketplace.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_221">“Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">eNotes</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://enotes.com/personal-selling-reference/personal-selling-178681">enotes.com/personal -selling-reference/personal-selling-178681</a>.</span> It stands to reason that successful small business owners should have the same sales skills.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p02">Although personal selling plays an important role in the sale of consumer products, it is even more important in the sale of industrial and business products. More than four times as many personal selling activities are directed toward industrial and business customers than toward consumers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_222">John M. Ivancevich and Thomas N. Duening, <em class="emphasis">Business Principles, Guidelines, and Practices</em> (Mason, OH: Thomson Learning, 2007), 431.</span> Regardless of the type of customer or consumer, however, the objectives of personal selling are the same:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_223">“Objectives of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/objectives-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/objectives-of -personal-selling</a>.</span></p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Building product awareness.</strong> A salesperson should educate customers and consumers on new product offerings.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Creating interest.</strong> Because personal selling is a person-to-person, and often a face-to-face, communication, it is a natural way for getting customers and consumers to experience a product for the first time. Creating interest goes hand-in-hand with building product awareness.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Providing information.</strong> A large part of the conversation with the customer focuses on product information.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stimulating demand.</strong> The most important objective of personal selling by far is persuading customers and consumers to make a purchase.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reinforcing the brand.</strong> Most personal selling focuses on building long-term relationships with customers and consumers. However, strong relationships can be built only over time, and they require regular communication.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p03">Like all other forms of marketing communications, personal selling offers both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, personal selling is flexible and dynamic, providing companies with the best opportunity to tailor a message to satisfy customers’ needs. Personal selling’s interactive nature also makes it the most effective promotional method for building relationships with customers, particularly in the B2B market, and it is the most practical promotional method for reaching customers who are not easily reached through other methods.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_224">“Advantages of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/advantages-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/advantages -of-personal-selling</a>.</span> Personal selling can help a small business build strong, loyal relationships with customers and consumers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p04">On the minus side, the biggest disadvantage may be the negative perceptions that many people have of salespeople: pushy, annoying, slippery, and willing to do anything for the sale—whether legal or not. The reality, of course, is that most salespeople (unfortunately, not all) do not fit this stereotype. The successful salesperson is the person who focuses his or her efforts on satisfying customers over the long term as opposed to his or her own selfish interests. Also on the negative side is the high cost of personal selling. Personal sales contacts are very expensive, with the costs incurred (compensation plus sales support) whether the sale is made or not.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_225">“Disadvantages of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling</a>.</span> Then there are the costs of training the sales staff on product knowledge, industry information, and perhaps selling skills.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_226">“Disadvantages of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling</a>.</span> Depending on the size of the company, small businesses will have varying numbers of salespeople, so some of the costs will vary as well.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p05">The traditional sales process is typically seen as a series of six steps:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_227">John M. Ivancevich and Thomas N. Duening, <em class="emphasis">Business Principles, Guidelines, and Practices</em> (Mason, OH: Thomson Learning, 2007), 435; Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 560–561; Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E. Clow, <em class="emphasis">Essentials of Marketing</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 489–98.</span></p>
            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_l02">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prospecting and qualifying.</strong> Locating potential customers who have a need for a product and the ability to pay for it. For example, prospects for a small electric motor company would be all the businesses that use small electric motors. Prospects can be found through a variety of sources, including current customers, trade directories, business associates, and newspaper or magazine articles.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Preapproach.</strong> It is important to learn as much about a prospect as you can. For example, you want to know about the prospect’s needs, attitudes about available products and brands, critical product attributes and benefits desired, and current vendor(s).</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Presentation and demonstration.</strong> This is where the salesperson tells the product “story” to the buyer: the product’s features, advantages, benefits, and value. It is important not to spend too much time on product features because benefits and value will most directly influence the purchase decision. It is also important to ask questions and listen carefully to a prospect’s answers because they will provide valuable insights into the prospect’s needs.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Overcoming objections.</strong> You should expect customers to pose objections. The key to overcoming these objections is to maintain a positive approach, ask the prospect to clarify the objections, and respond to the objections by reiterating the major benefits of the product or the service and pointing out additional features, guarantees, service, and anything else that would address the objections.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Closing.</strong> This is when the salesperson asks the prospect to buy the product. The request can be direct, or the salesperson can encourage the purchase by using a trial closing approach like asking, “Would you like us to finance product A for you?” Closing the sale is understandably the most difficult step for many salespeople because of the fear that the prospect will say no.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Follow-up and maintenance.</strong> These activities are necessary for customer satisfaction and repeat business. They are key to establishing the strong long-term relationships that every small business desires and needs. The salesperson should schedule a follow-up call to ensure proper installation, instruction, servicing, and troubleshooting and resolution should any problems be detected. Always remember that unhappy customers will defect to competition—and they will spread negative comments about the company. Because it is much cheaper to retain an old customer than to obtain new ones, it is in a company’s best interests to provide good follow-up and maintenance services.</li>
            </ol>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p06">Although these steps are helpful as a way to summarize the kinds of things that are relevant to personal selling, the Internet has revolutionized the selling process.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_228">Thomas Young, “A Selling Revolution: How the Internet Changed Personal Selling (Part 1),” <em class="emphasis">Executive Street</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.vistage.com/marketing/a-selling-revolution-how-the-internet-changed-personal-selling">blog.vistage.com/marketing/a-selling-revolution-how-the-internet-changed-personal-selling</a>.</span> The traditional process just described has become largely obsolete, with roles changing. Web searches and online content help prospective customers or clients do their own prospecting and qualifying. This eliminates the most time-consuming part of the traditional sales process. A company’s website becomes the first sales presentation and, as a result, is critical in moving a prospect toward a sale. In short, all employees must be fully integrated into web marketing because web marketing is the primary driver of the sales process. The more web-savvy you are, the greater the chances that your selling will beat the competition.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_229">Thomas Young, “A Selling Revolution: How the Internet Changed Personal Selling (Part 1),” <em class="emphasis">Executive Street</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blog.vistage.com/marketing/a-selling-revolution-how-the-internet-changed-personal-selling">blog.vistage.com/marketing/a-selling-revolution-how-the-internet-changed-personal-selling</a>.</span></p>

                    <li>Promotion and marketing communications are relatively synonymous terms.</li>
                    <li>IMC is about pulling all the marketing communications together to convey a consistent message.</li>
                    <li>Small-business owners should be familiar and comfortable with the terms <em class="emphasis">promotion</em>, <em class="emphasis">marketing communications</em>, and <em class="emphasis">integrated marketing communications (IMC)</em>.</li>
                    <li>There are multiple categories of IMC objectives.</li>
                    <li>The marketing communications mix for a small business will consist of some combination of advertising, sales promotion, events and experiences, PR and publicity, direct marketing, interactive marketing, and personal selling. This mix is applicable to both pure-play and brick-and-click businesses.</li>
                    <li>There is a lot of hype about blogs and social media. They can be very effective, but they have not worked well for all small businesses that have used them. They should be considered carefully before inclusion in a company’s IMC strategy.</li>

                    <li>Frank’s All-American BarBeQue has historically taken a very low-key approach to promoting the business, choosing to rely on word-of-mouth communication. Robert believes that Frank needs to increase the sophistication of the marketing communications. Design an IMC plan for Frank’s BarBeQue. Keep the following in mind: (1) Frank’s is a small business with a very limited IMC budget; (2) advertising in prime time and national television are not options; and (3) Frank’s is selling both food and its BBQ sauces.</li>
                    <li>Choose two products or services that you purchased recently from small businesses, one from an online business and one from an onground business. The products should be different from those chosen for price. For each product or service, identify the various media that were used to promote the product or the service and analyze the marketing communications mix. Do you agree with the marketing communications mix that was used? What recommendations would you make for change?<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_230">Adapted from David L. Kurtz, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011), 488.</span> <em class="emphasis">Tip</em>: If you are not sure whether an online business can be considered a small business, type in the name of the business plus “corporate HQ” into Google or your preferred search engine. The search should return results that include the number of employees. As long as the company has fewer than five hundred employees, you are all set.</li>
