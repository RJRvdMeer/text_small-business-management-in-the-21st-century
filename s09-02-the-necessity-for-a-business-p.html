    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_p02">A recent study found that there was a near doubling of successful growth for those businesses that completed business plans compared to those that did not create one. It must be pointed out that this study might be viewed as being biased because the founder of the software company whose main product is a program that builds business plans conducted the study. However, the results were examined by academics from the University of Oregon who validated the overall results. They found that “except in a small number of cases, business planning appeared to be positively correlated with business success as measured by our variables. While our analysis cannot say the completing of a business plan will lead to success, it does indicate that the type of entrepreneur who completes a business plan is also more likely to produce a successful business.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_021">Rieva Lesonsky, “A Small Business Plan Doubles Your Chances for Success, Says a New Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, June 20, 2010, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/business-plan-success-twice-as-likely.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/business-plan-success-twice-as-likely.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_p03">Basically, there are two main reasons for developing a comprehensive business plan: (1) a plan will be extraordinarily useful in ensuring the successful operation of your business; and (2) if one is seeking to secure external funds from banks, venture capitalists, or other investors, it is essential that you be able to demonstrate to them that they will be recovering their money and making a profit. Let us examine each reason in detail.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_p04">Many small business owners operate under a mistaken belief that the only time that they need to create a business plan is at the birth of the company or when they are attempting to raise additional capital from external sources. They fail to realize that a business plan can be an important element in ensuring day-to-day success.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_p05">The initial planning process aids the operational success of a small business by allowing the owner a chance to review, in detail, the viability of the business idea. It forces one to rigorously consider some key questions:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_l02">
        <li>Is the business strategy feasible?</li>
        <li>What are the chances it will make money?</li>
        <li>Do I have the operational requirements for starting and running a successful business?</li>
        <li>Have I considered a well-thought-out marketing plan that clearly identifies who my customers will be?</li>
        <li>Do I clearly understand what value I will provide to these customers?</li>
        <li>What will be the means of distribution to provide the product or the service to my customers?</li>
        <li>Have I clarified to myself the financial issues associated with starting and operating the business?</li>
        <li>Do I have to reexamine these notions to ensure success?</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_p06">Possessing an actual written plan enables you to have people outside the organization evaluate your business plan. Using friends, colleagues, partners, or even consultants may provide you with an unbiased evaluation of the assumptions.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_p07">It is not enough to create an initial business plan; you should anticipate making the planning process an annual activity. The Prussian military theorist von Moltke once argued that no military plan survives the first engagement with the enemy. Likewise, no company evolves in the same way as outlined in its initial business plan.</p>

        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p01">Unfortunately, it appears that many small businesses do not make any effort to build even an initial business plan, let alone maintain a planning process as an ongoing operation, even though there is clear evidence that the failure to plan may have serious consequences for the future success of such firms. This unwillingness to plan may be understandable in nonemployee businesses, but it is inexcusable as a business grows in size. Why, therefore, do some businesses fail to begin the planning process?</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">We do not need to plan.</strong> One of the prime reasons individuals fail to produce a business plan is that they believe that they do not have to plan. This may be attributable to the size of the firm; nonemployee firms that have no intention of seeking outside financing might sincerely believe that they have no need for a formal business plan. Others may believe that they so well understand the business and/or industry that they can survive and prosper without the <em class="emphasis">burdensome</em> process of a business plan. The author of <em class="emphasis">Business Plan for Dummies</em>, Paul Tiffany, once argued that if one feels lucky enough to operate a business successfully without resorting to a business plan, then he or she should forget about starting a business and head straight to Las Vegas.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">I am too busy to plan.</strong> Anyone who has ever run a business on his or her own can understand this argument. The day-to-day demands of operating a business may make it seem that there is insufficient time to engage in any ancillary activity or prepare a business plan. Individuals who accept this argument often fail to recognize that the seemingly endless buzz of activities, such as constantly putting out fires, may be the direct result of not having thought about the future and planned for it in the first place.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Plans do not produce results.</strong> Small-business owners (entrepreneurs) are action- and results-oriented individuals. They want to see a tangible outcome for their efforts, and preferably they would like to see the results as soon as possible. The idea of sitting down and producing a large document based on assumptions that may not play out exactly as predicted is viewed as a futile exercise. However, those with broader experience understand that there will be no external funding for growth or the initial creation of the business without the existence of a well-thought-out plan. Although plans may not yield the specified results contained within them, the process of thinking about the plan and building it often yield results that the owner might not initially appreciate.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">We are not familiar with the process of formal planning.</strong> This argument might initially appear to have more validity than the others. Developing a comprehensive business plan is a daunting task. It might seem difficult if not impossible for someone with no experience with the concept. Several studies have indicated that small business owners are more likely to engage in the planning process if they have had prior experience with planning models in their prior work experience.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_022">H. Hodges and T. Kent, “Impact of Planning and Control Sophistication in Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Small Business Strategy</em> 17, no. 2 (2006–7): 75.</span> Fortunately, this situation has changed rather significantly in the last decade. As we will illustrate in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03#cadden_1.0-ch05_s03">Section 5.3 "Building a Plan"</a>, there are numerous tools that provide significant support for the development of business plans. We will see that software packages greatly facilitate the building of any business plan, including marketing plans and financial plans for small businesses. We also show that the Internet can provide an unbelievably rich source of data and information to assist in the building of these plans.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s01_p02">Although one could understand the reticence of someone new to small business (or in some cases even seasoned entrepreneurs), their arguments fall short with respect to the benefits that will be derived from conducting a structured and comprehensive business planning process.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Plans for Raising Capital</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_p01">Every business plan should be written with a particular audience in mind. The annual business plan should be written with a management team and for the employees who have to implement the plan. However, one of the prime reasons for writing a business plan is to secure investment funds for the firm. Of course, funding the business could be done by an individual using his or her own personal wealth, personal loans, or extending credit cards. Individuals also can seek investments from family and friends. The focus here will be on three other possible sources of capital—banks, venture capitalists, and angel investors. It is important to understand what they look for in a business plan. Remember that these three groups are investors, so they will be anticipating, at the very least, the ability to recover their initial investment if not earn a significant return.</p>
        <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Bankers</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p01">Bankers, like all businesspeople, are interested in earning a profit; they want to see a return on their investment. However, unlike other investors, bankers are under a legal obligation to ensure that the borrower pledge some form of collateral to secure the loan.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_023">Tim Berry, “What Bankers Look for in a Business Plan…and What You Should Expect When Taking Your Business Plan to a Bank,” <em class="emphasis">AllBusiness.com</em>, November 7, 2006, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/business-planning-structures/business-plans/3878953-1.html">www.allbusiness.com/business-planning-structures/business-plans/3878953-1.html</a>.</span> This often means that banks are unwilling to fund a start-up business unless the owner is willing to pledge some form of collateral, such as a second mortgage on his or her home. Many first-time business owners are not in a position to do that; securing money from a bank occurs most frequently for an existing business that is looking to expand or for covering a short-term cash-flow need. Banks may lend to small business owners who are opening a second business provided that they can prove a record of success and profitability.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p02">Banks will require a business plan. It should be understood that bank loan officers will initially focus on the financial components of that client, namely, the income statement, balance sheet, and the cash-flow statement. The bank will examine your projections with respect to known industry standards. Therefore, the business plan should not project a 75 percent profit margin when the industry standard is 15 percent, unless the author of the plan can clearly document why he or she will be earning such a high return.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s01_p03">Some businesses may raise funds with the assistance of a Small Business Administration (SBA) loan. These loans are always arranged through a commercial bank. With these loans, the SBA will pledge up to 70 percent of the total value of the loan. This means that the owner still must provide, at the very least, 30 percent of the total collateral. The ability to secure one of these loans is clearly tied to the adequacy of the business plan.</p>

        <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Venture Capitalists</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p01">Another possible source of funding is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">venture capitalists</a><span class="glossdef">Individuals who provide money for start-up businesses or additional capital for a business to grow. They invest to make not only a profit but also returns that are substantially above those found in the market.</span></span>. The first thing that one should realize about venture capitalists is that they are not in it just to make a profit; they want to make returns that are substantially above those to be found in the market. For some, this translates into the ability to secure five to ten times their initial investment and recapture their investment in a relatively short period of time—often less than five years. It has been reported that some venture capitalists are looking for returns in the order of twenty-five times their original investment.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_024">Marc Mays, “Small Business Venture Capital Strategies,” <em class="emphasis">eZine Articles</em>, 2010, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ezinearticles.com/?Small-Business-Venture-Capital-Strategies&amp;id=4714691">ezinearticles.com/?Small-Business-Venture-Capital-Strategies &amp;id=4714691</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p02">The financial statement, particularly the profit margin, is obviously important to venture capitalists, but they will also be looking at other factors. The quality of the management team identified in the business plan will be examined. They will be looking at the team’s experience and track record. Other factors needed by venture capitalists may include the projected growth rate of the market, the extent to which the product or the service being offered is unique, the overall size of the market, and the probability of producing a highly successful product or service.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s02_s02_s02_p03">Businesses that are seeking financing from banks know that they must go to loan officers who will review the plan, even though a computerized loan assessment program may make the final decision. With venture capitalists, on the other hand, you often need to have a personal introduction to have your plan considered. You should also anticipate that you will have to make a presentation to venture capitalists. This means that you have to understand your plan and be able to present it in a dynamic fashion.</p>

Many angel investors are themselves successful entrepreneurs. As with venture capitalists, they are looking for returns higher than they can normally find in the market; however, they often expect returns lower than those anticipated by venture capitalist. They may be attracted to business plans because of an innovative concept or the excitement of entering a new type of business. Being successful small business owners, many angel investors will not only provide capital to fund the business but also bring their own expertise and experience to help the business grow. It has been estimated that these angel investors provide between three and ten times as much money as venture capitalists for the development of small businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_025">“The Importance of Angel Investing in Financing the Growth of Entrepreneurial Ventures,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Notes</em>, September 2008, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/rs331.html">www.smallbusinessnotes.com/aboutsb/rs331.html</a>.</span></p>

They expect a comprehensive business plan—one that clearly specifies the future direction of the firm. They also will look at the management team not only for its track record and experience but also their (the angel investor’s) ability to work with this team. Angel investors may take a much more active role in the management of the business, asking for positions on the board of directors, taking an equity position in the firm, demanding quarterly reports, or demanding that the business not take certain actions unless it has the approval of these angel investors. These investors will take a much more hands-on approach to the operations of a firm.</p>
