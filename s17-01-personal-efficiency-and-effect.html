    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_p01">Open any basic management textbook, and there will always be a discussion of the importance for an organization to be both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">effective</a><span class="glossdef">Achieving the outcomes that someone wishes to produce.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">efficient</a><span class="glossdef">Producing the desired results with the minimum expenditure of energy, time, money, personnel, or material.</span></span>. These are fundamental concepts. An organization demonstrates effectiveness when it achieves the outcomes that it wishes to produce.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_003">Amitai Etzioni, <em class="emphasis">Modern Organizations</em> (Englewood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice Hall, 1964), 17.</span> Efficiency is “the capacity of an organization, institution or business to produce the desired results with the minimum expenditure of energy, time, money, personnel, material, etc.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_004">“Efficiency, Organizational,” <em class="emphasis">Mondofacto</em>, December 12, 1998, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?efficiency%2C+organizational">www.mondofacto.com/facts/dictionary?efficiency%2C+organizational</a>.</span> In discussing the distinction between the two concepts, Peter Drucker once said, “Efficiency is doing things right; effectiveness is doing the right things.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_005">“Peter Drucker Quotes,” <em class="emphasis">Brainy Quote</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/p/peter_drucker.html">www.brainyquote.com/quotes/authors/p/peter_drucker.html</a>.</span> Regardless of the exact definition of these concepts, it should be clear that any business should strive to be both effective and efficient.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_p02">It is important to recognize that for any given endeavor, one can be effective and but not efficient and vice versa. This can be illustrated with the following example. Two students are working in their college mail room. Each is given a stack of five hundred individual class schedules that are to be sorted and placed in the mailboxes of the undergraduate students. They are told that when they are done, they will be given another job. The first student is meticulous and carefully checks that each class schedule goes to the right recipient. She completes the job in 4.5 hours. The second student is less careful about accuracy and makes several errors by putting the wrong schedule in the wrong box. However, he completes his work in 3 hours. The first student was effective because the task was to get the right schedule to the right student. The second student was more efficient, if efficiency is measured in the number of schedules dispensed per hour.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_p03">In the late 1950s and early 1960s, two important works on the nature of a firm introduced an expanded concept known as “organizational slack.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_006">James G. March and Herbert A. Simon, <em class="emphasis">Organizations</em> (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1958), 46; Richard M. Cyert and James G. March, <em class="emphasis">A Behavioral Theory of the Firm</em> (Oxford, UK: Blackwell, 1963), 121.</span> Slack was seen as the excess capacity maintained by an organization. By definition, slack implies that an organization is not perfectly efficient. Some argue that slack provides resources for innovation and change. Others see it as a buffer for a firm.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_007">Joseph L. C. Cheng and Idalene F. Kesner, “Organizational Slack and Response to Environmental Shifts: The Impact of Resource Allocation Patterns,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Management</em> 23, no. 1 (1997): 1–18.</span> Although these debates might make for interesting academic discussions, it must be recognized that most small businesses do not have the luxury of maintaining any appreciable slack. Their survival hinges on being <em class="emphasis">both</em> highly effective and highly efficient. Therefore, any technique, program, or methodology that improves those ends is vital to the well-being of a small business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p01">Throughout this chapter, the focus will be on the simple fact that one of the great enemies in life—particularly a businessperson’s life—is the existence and acceptance of waste. One of the resources that we can least afford to waste is time. In many ways, time is the most precious of all resources. Other resources can often be purchased or acquired, but time cannot be purchased. Once lost, time can never be recaptured. Time, as a resource, should be of particular importance for the small business owner.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p02">If one is serious about maximizing the use of time, then one should consider two venues: use a time-management system and avoid what are referred to as “time wasters.” The term <em class="emphasis">time-management system</em> is a broad concept and covers many different approaches. Regardless of the approach used, its adoption provides multiple benefits. As one author puts it—“‘<span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Time management</a><span class="glossdef">Working on the right things (effectiveness) and doing them the best way (efficiency).</span></span>’ involves working on the right things [effectiveness] and doing them the best way [efficiency].”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_009">Peggy Duncan, <em class="emphasis">The Time Management Memory Jogger</em> (Salem, NH: Goal/QPC Publishers, 2008), xi.</span> Steven Covey, author of <em class="emphasis">First Things First</em>,<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_010">Steven Covey, A.

A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">third-generation time-management system</a><span class="glossdef">A system that incorporates a system of prioritization to tasks that must be done.</span></span> incorporates task prioritization. Many businesspeople are familiar with paper-and-pencil or computerized systems for listing tasks, noting their due dates, and prioritizing them in terms of relative importance. Covey argues for a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">fourth-generation time-management system</a><span class="glossdef">A system designed to bring balance into the personal and professional life of an individual.</span></span>. This system is designed to bring balance into the personal and the professional lives of individuals. It is best illustrated by Covey’s 2 × 2 matrix, where one axis is composed of tasks that can be categorized as <em class="emphasis">urgent</em> or <em class="emphasis">not urgent</em>. The other axis is composed of tasks that can be characterized as either <em class="emphasis">important</em> or <em class="emphasis">not important</em> (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_f01">Figure 13.1 "Time-Management Matrix"</a>). He emphasizes that those tasks that might be found in the <em class="emphasis">important/not urgent</em> quadrant (quadrant 2) might be critical to an individual’s well-being. Unfortunately, because they are listed as <em class="emphasis">not urgent</em>, they might fall by the wayside. His goal is to produce a “balanced manager.” This balance refers to what he argues are the four fundamental human needs: physical needs, social needs, mental needs, and spiritual needs. His approach to time management is based on valuing relationships and recognizing that the proper management of relationships will reduce the amount of time wasted in activities.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p03">Covey advocates that an individual should have a deep understanding of what is important in one’s life and recognize that, on any day, one will assume different roles. Both elements need to be incorporated into the time-management system. For Covey, we all have to assume different roles in our personal and professional lives. The objective is to identify what these roles require time-wise and how they can be successfully integrated. To achieve integration, we need to better understand ourselves. Covey suggests that developing a personal mission statement is vital to achieving balance. Some characteristics of such a statement might include the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_l01">
            <li>What represents the deepest and best within a person?</li>
            <li>What is an expression of a person’s unique capacity to contribute to one’s family, the organization, and the world at large?</li>
            <li>What represents pursuits that are higher than self-interest?</li>
            <li>What integrates all four fundamental human needs?</li>
            <li>What principles produce quality-of-life results?</li>
            <li>What inspires a person?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p04">The following is an example of a personal mission statement that uses the Covey approach:</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p17">Covey’s complete system of time management is comprehensive and is supported by both paper-and-pencil and software support materials.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p18">If Covey’s comprehensive approach appears to be initially overwhelming, where else might a person begin to improve their time-management skills? An excellent—in fact a critical—takeoff point would be to ask the following question: “Where has the time gone?” How often have we asked ourselves or heard others pose this question, and how often are we unable to answer it? Until one has a solid idea of how time is spent, it is impossible to manage time effectively. It is comparable to beginning a journey to a location without knowing the exact starting point. An excellent way of knowing how time is spent is to use an activity log.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p19">An <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">activity log</a><span class="glossdef">A technique that involves writing down every task and activity that one is involved with during a day.</span></span> involves writing down every task and activity a person is involved with during a day. It also requires noting when these activities occurred during the day and how long they lasted. It would be very useful to also comment on one’s emotional state and energy level while performing these tasks and activities. The log should be maintained for a period of time—generally one or two weeks. At the end of this period, analyze how time was spent. This analysis should look for some common threads:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_l05">
            <li>How much time per day or week is spent on particular activities?</li>
            <li>When during the day did you feel the most productive?</li>
            <li>When during the day did you feel the least productive or have the most disruptions to workflow?</li>
            <li>What activities were individuals who created these disruptions to workflow?</li>
            <li>What activities seem to provide little or no value?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p20">The goal of this analysis is to identify what task or activity should be eliminated and when, if there is a pattern to productivity, a high-value challenging task should be scheduled. The activity log should provide useful insights into how a person should structure time flow.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_011">“Activity Logs: Finding Out How You Really Spend Your Time,” <em class="emphasis">Mind Tools</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_03.htm">www.mindtools.com/pages/article/newHTE_03.htm</a>.</span> As one author put it, “Find your rhythm and schedule around.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_012">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p21">After identifying workflow patterns, then seriously begin planning for time management. The first stage of this process involves identifying the required tasks to be performed across various time horizons, such as the upcoming year, month, week, or day. Draw on Covey and others to include a broad spectrum of life activities, not just work-oriented activities.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_013">Rachna D. Jain, “10 Ways for Entrepreneurs to Find More Time,” <em class="emphasis">PowerHomeBiz.com</em>, September 9, 2003, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol124/findtime.htm">www.powerhomebiz.com/vol124/findtime.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s01_s01_p22">In addition to identifying these tasks, it is vital that a person prioritize these tasks. Some tasks are clearly more important than others. As an example, securing a major sale would have a much higher priority than selecting the appropriate stationery for a business. The next step is determining—or more likely estimating—how much time and what resources will be required to complete the tasks. Use these estimates of time to generate a to-do list specifying the completion date for the tasks and the activities. Plan on working within realistic blocks of time.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_014">Susan Giurleo, “11 Time Management Tips for Small Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">DrSusanGiurleo.com</em>, April 11, 2011, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success">drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success</a>.</span> When dealing with a large complex project, learn to break it down into manageable segments and components.</p>

It means that at times we must stop activities that would become time robbers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_018">Carol Halsey, “The Greatest Technique of Time Management,” <em class="emphasis">PowerHomeBiz.com</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.powerhomebiz.com/vol94/time.htm">www.powerhomebiz.com/vol94/time.htm</a>.</span> What about the colleague who drifts into your work space and asks, “Do you have a few minutes?” When we know that this colleague will be talking more about his or her own personal life rather than work-related activities, then we must have the courage to say, “Sorry, but I do not have the time.” In periods of time pressure, we must even find strength to forgo some activities, such as going out to lunch.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_019">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to not procrastinate.</strong> For many of us, this is the great challenge. It is best dealt with by maintaining a clear focus on the required tasks. This is why a to-do list of tasks tied with prioritization is so important. One way to deal with procrastination is to concentrate on one task and staying with the task until it is complete.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_020">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span> Another form of procrastination is the willing acceptance of wasting time. Waiting is a form of wasting time if one is not engaged in some useful activity while waiting for some other outcome—such as working while on hold during a phone call.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_021">Susan Giurleo, “11 Time Management Tips for Small Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">DrSusanGiurleo.com</em>, April 11, 2011, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success">drsusangiurleo.com/11-time-management-tips-for-small-business-success</a>.</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Learn to manage e-mail.</strong> One of the greatest sources of time wasting is the improper management of e-mail. The ping announcing a new e-mail message often lures one away from productive work to read the message. One should plan set blocks of time during the day to handle e-mail. Outside these blocks, one should not open any e-mail. E-mail should be approached so that each item can be dealt with once and then eliminated.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_022">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span> One should also be prepared to “on deadline days…put up the equivalent of a ‘do not disturb sign.’”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_023">“5 Time-Management Tricks,” <em class="emphasis">Shifting Careers</em>, December 12, 2007, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks">shiftingcareers.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/12/12/5-time-management-tricks</a>.</span>
