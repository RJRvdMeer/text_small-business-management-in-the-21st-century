        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p01">John Bello and Tom Schwalm founded SoBe Beverages in Norwalk, Connecticut, in 1996. The name is an abbreviation of South Beach, the well-known upscale area in Miami, Florida. John describes SoBe as playfully irreverent, having brand equity with meaning, a cult brand that resonates in the marketplace. He attributes the company’s success to some luck, missteps by the competition, being aggressive, and tapping into a cultural shift.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p02">SoBe tapped into a cultural shift toward healthier living and wellness and the rise of companies like General Nutrition that focused on wellness products: vitamins, supplements, minerals, and herbs. Their first product, Black Tea 3G, contained ginseng, guarana, and ginkgo. Orange Carrot, another of SoBe’s first successful products, is a blend of orange and carrot juices enhanced with calcium, chromium picolinate, and carnitine. An extensive line of other flavors was added. All ingredients were linked to specific health benefits.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p03">The first two years of operation saw SoBe losing money, but by the end of 1997, the company was on fire. In five years, the company went from $0 to $300 million in sales, and it became a national brand. SoBe was competing effectively at a premium price. Coca-Cola, Pepsi, Arizona, and other brands took notice. Within three years, Coca-Cola was talking to SoBe about a possible strategic partnership. There were fifteen meetings, only two of which were with marketing. The rest were with corporate lawyers (John calls them “sales preventers”) and regulators. At the end of 1999, Minute Maid presented the proposal to the Coca-Cola board. Surprisingly, it was rejected. Coca-Cola saw no reason to go beyond carbonated soft drinks, and there were also some leadership issues. Back to square one.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p04">John and Tom started looking at liquidation because of pressure from investors who wanted their money. But there were other reasons they thought about selling. They were not interested in managing a disparate group of investors—bankers, investors, and private equity companies. With 250 employees, the company was growing into something they did not want it to be—and they were not having as much fun. In 2000, the market was flattening, so with a big brand image, it was a good time to get out. They also wanted to get into larger markets, such as schools and golf clubs, but only big companies could get them into a broader marketplace. They hired an investment bank and again went into negotiations with Coca-Cola as a strategic partner. The situation became very complicated and frustrating. Ultimately, a deal with Coca-Cola was again a no-go.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p05">All was not lost. Pepsi (and others) had expressed an interest. John made a presentation to forty people at Pepsi—rather than the multiple presentations he had to make to Coca-Cola—and within two weeks, they had a deal. SoBe was sold in 2000 to Pepsi for an impressive $370 million…a very nice return on an investment of $7 million in cash and $1 million in trade-out services. Part of the deal was that John would stay on at Pepsi for two years to manage the brand, but after one day, it was clear to him that he was not going to be managing anything. Things were moved into committee, and the corporate bureaucracy took over. John likened the experience to “Making Ho Chi Minh a general in the US Army,” that is, he had a very different way of doing things. He is independent, is unconventional, speaks his mind, and would rather do things and make them work—an approach that tends to be at odds with the culture in large corporations.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p06">SoBe inspired a whole line of functional beverages that people like to buy to make them feel smarter, healthier, and sexier. The company helped to build careers that have lasted. John is very happy with his legacy…and with his piece of the $370 million sale price.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p07">Most textbooks on small business and entrepreneurship emphasize, quite correctly, the benefits and joys of owning and operating one’s own business. However, they often neglect to cover many of the challenges of continuing to operate a business successfully—the icebergs that can sink a business. The first half of this chapter covers one of the biggest icebergs: a natural or a man-made disaster and the disaster planning that should precede it. Being able to anticipate a disaster will contribute significantly to its effective handling so that a business can survive.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_p08">Even if a small business survives a disaster or another kind of iceberg, the owner may still wish to walk away. If a business does not survive, the owner will have no choice but to walk away. There may be other reasons forcing the owner to walk away, or escape, as well. The second half of this chapter discusses the forced escape and the other end of the spectrum—when things go so well that the business owner is ready to move on to another phase of his or her life. In both cases, an exit strategy will be required.</p>

Planning for the complexity of what lies below the tip is important for every small business. Small- to medium-sized businesses are the most vulnerable in the event of a disaster.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_001">“Planning Can Cut Disaster Recovery Time, Expense,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_da_dprep_howtoprep.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_da_dprep_howtoprep.pdf</a>.</span> It has been estimated by the US Department of Labor that 40 percent of businesses never reopen following a disaster. At least 25 percent of the remaining companies will close within two years. The Association of Records Managers and Administrators estimated that over 60 percent of small businesses that experience a major disaster close by the end of two years.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_002">Darrell Zahorsky, “Disaster Recovery Decision Making for Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/disastermanagement/a/disasterrecover.htm">sbinformation.about.com/od/disastermanagement/a/disasterrecover.htm</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_p02">Given these odds, planning for disaster recovery makes great sense—even if, in the end, walking away makes the most sense. If a small business owner decides to rebuild, the process can begin after human health and safety are restored, the electricity is back on, and transportation is up and running. Everyone will want life to return to normal following the destruction, but that may not be possible for every small business. The market may change. Conditions may change, and a business must change to succeed in disaster recovery.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_003">Darrell Zahorsky, “Disaster Recovery Decision Making for Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinformation.about.com/od/disastermanagement/a/disasterrecover.htm">sbinformation.about.com/od/disastermanagement/a/disasterrecover.htm</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p01">In the film <em class="emphasis">Apollo 13</em>, astronauts and engineers went through seemingly endless simulations of what might go wrong on a flight to the moon. The astronauts complained that some of the scenarios were unrealistic and almost impossible to occur. But when a near disaster occurred on Apollo 13, the engineers and astronauts were confronted with a problem that had never been considered; however, because of their prior experience with disaster training, they were able to develop a solution.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p02">Rather than being negative, anticipating what can go wrong can be profoundly positive through either prevention or quickly responding to a crisis. The wise small business owner should appreciate Murphy’s Law (“Anything that can go wrong will go wrong”) and Murphy’s first corollary (“And it will go wrong at the worst possible moment”). The most pragmatic small business owner will also realize that Murphy was an optimist.</p>

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s01_p05">Joe Bogner of Dodge City, Kansas, learned the importance of disaster planning firsthand. He owns Western Beverage, Inc., a beverage distribution company serving twenty-nine counties in western Kansas. In 2002, Western Beverage sustained millions of dollars in fire damage. Yet the company resumed deliveries after just three days. Bogner was named the Kansas City Small Businessperson of the Year for 2006, partially because of his company’s ability to respond to adversity. As his nomination package stated, “Setting up plans of action and following through are Joe’s way of life.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s01_s02_p01">A business owner has invested a tremendous amount of time, money, resources, and emotions into building a business, so he or she will want to be able to survive a natural or man-made disaster. This requires taking a proactive approach so that the chances of the business surviving are increased. Unfortunately, nothing can be done to guarantee the survival of a business because there is no way to know what kind of disaster may occur—or when. There is also no way to know what kind of business environment the owner will face after the disaster. There are, however, several things can be done to increase those chances of survival. Resist the temptation to put emergency planning on the back burner.</p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Explore cybersecurity liability insurance.</strong> This coverage is available at reasonable rates to protect against credit card identity theft, with limits up to $5 million. This insurance will cover the loss of digital assets plus expenses for public relations, damages, and service interruption. It will also protect customers. The notification of customers whose credit was compromised is included plus any legal costs and a year of credit monitoring for each individual affected.

Perhaps the owner wants to sell the business before retirement. Perhaps someone has approached the owner with a terrific offer. Perhaps investors are pressuring the owner for their money. Perhaps no one in the owner’s family wants to take over the business. Perhaps it is no longer fun; the entrepreneurial spirit is gone, and the owner’s passion has changed.

        <li>Instead of being the most optimistic person on the team, the owner starts taking a negative view on most of the decisions the team is making about future prospects for growth.</li>
        <li>Continuing with the business may have serious, lasting personal repercussions, such as threatening one’s marriage, familial relationships, or health. The potential risk is no longer worth the reward.</li>
        <li>The owner sees the writing on the wall: no repeat or referral customers, no positive feedback from any source, or no demand for the business’s product or service.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Negotiate debt.</strong> This involves trying to reorganize a business’s finances outside a legal proceeding.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s04_s06_p01">Another possible exit strategy is selling the business.

As in the case of SoBe (highlighted at the beginning of this chapter), the owners sold the business because, among other things, it was becoming something they did not want it to be—and it was no longer fun. Whatever the reason, an owner can sell a business only once, so be sure that it is the right exit strategy. The owner should address the following questions:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_092">Barbara Taylor, “How to Sell Your Business,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, January 7, 2010, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/business/smallbusiness/07guide.html">www.nytimes.com/2010/01/07/business/smallbusiness/07guide.html</a>; Anthony Tjan, “The Founder’s Dilemma: To Sell or Not to Sell?,” <em class="emphasis">Harvard Business Review</em>, February 18, 2011, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://blogs.hbr.org/tjan/2011/02/the-founders-dilemma-to-sell-o.html">blogs.hbr.org/tjan/2011/02/the-founders-dilemma-to-sell-o.html</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Can the business be sold?</strong> There are many things that make a business attractive to buyers: a solid history of profitability, a large and loyal base of customers, a good reputation, a competitive advantage (e.g., intellectual property rights, patents, long-term contracts with clients, and exclusive distributorships), opportunities for growth, a desirable location, a skilled workforce, and a loyal workforce. If a business does not have at least some of these things or others of equal value, it will not likely generate much interest in the market.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Is the owner ready to sell or does the owner need to sell?</strong> Selling a business, when it is a choice, requires emotional and financial readiness. The owner must think about what life will be like after the business is sold. What will be a source of income? How will time be spent? Has the owner “sold out” or could more have been done with the business? Does the owner love what he or she is doing? Many small business owners suffer real remorse after handing their businesses over to a new owner. Selling the business because the owner is forced to will engender very different emotional and financial challenges.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">What is the business worth?</strong> The owner may have no idea. For example, the owner of a small professional services firm felt the firm was worth more than $1 million. After a lengthy search, however, the owner received less than one-half that amount from the buyer. On the other side of the coin, the owner of an information technology (IT) company planned to sell the company to an employee for $200,000. However, after advertising the business for sale nationwide, the owner sold it for one dollar shy of $1 million.</li>

However, because the owner is giving control of the business to the employees, a transition plan is critical to make sure that they are ready to carry on the business after the owner leaves. It is a good idea to hire an ESOP specialist. Keep in mind, though, that only corporations are eligible to form an ESOP.

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s04_s06_s04_l01">
                    <li>The most emotional topic an owner will face when building a business—and the hardest decision he or she will probably have to make—is when and how to exit.</li>
                    <li>An exit strategy should be planned while running the business. Unfortunately, many small businesses do not have an exit plan.</li>
                    <li>There are many exit strategies that a small business owner can consider, including liquidation or walkaway, family succession, selling the business, bankruptcy, and taking a company public.</li>
                    <li>The best exit strategy is the one that best matches the small business and the owner’s personal and professional goals.</li>
                    <li>Liquidation is the selling of all assets. If all debts are paid, it can also be referred to as a walkaway. Walking away is the cleanest and best way to exit a business.</li>
                    <li>Family succession is the transference of leadership from one generation to the next to ensure continuity of family ownership in the business. It is a critical issue in family businesses because few family firms survive beyond the first generation and even fewer survive into the third generation.</li>
                    <li>The failure to plan for succession is seen as a basic human resource problem as well as the primary cause for the poor survival rate of family businesses.</li>
                    <li>Bankruptcy is an extreme exit strategy that uses a legal method for closing a business and paying off creditors when a business is failing and the debts are substantially greater than the assets.</li>
                    <li>Debt negotiations, operational improvements, or business turnaround and restructuring are alternatives to bankruptcy.</li>
                    <li>An IPO is a stock offering in which the owner or owners of equity in a business have their private holdings transferred into issues tradable in public markets, such as the NYSE.</li>
                    <li>There are several options for selling a business: acquisition, friendly buyout, selling to the employees, and selling in the open market.</li>
                    <li>An acquisition is when another business buys a business. In an acquisition, there is no limit on the perceived value of the business.</li>
                    <li>A friendly buyout is the transfer of ownership to family members, customers, employees, current managers, children, or friends—but it is still a sale.</li>
                    <li>Selling to the employees can be a win-win situation because they get an established business that they know a great deal about already, and the owner gets enthusiastic buyers who want to see a business continue to thrive.</li>
                    <li>Selling in the open market is the most popular exit strategy for small businesses.</li>
                    <li>It has been estimated that 75 percent of small businesses do not sell, so a business must market in a way that maximizes its value in the eyes of the potential buyer.</li>

They recently learned that Frank has been selling his sauces in local grocery stores and have been a big hit. The executives bought jars of each flavor, took them back to their company, and talked to the people who would decide about adding products to their line. Everyone loved the sauces, and there was definite interest in acquiring the sauce-making side of Frank’s business. It would fill a hole in their product line that they had been looking to fill.</p>
