            <li>“Family members assume they know what other family members feel or want.”</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s04_p02">These difficulties can be overcome if the family business makes a concerted effort to create and maintain an environment of open communication where people feel comfortable voicing opinions and concerns.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s05_p01">It is natural for a family business to employ family members, especially in management positions.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s05_s03_p01">There will be times when the better decision may be to hire a nonfamily person for a particular job. Experience has shown that a family business is less likely to be successful if it employs only family members; bringing in the fresh thinking that comes with external expertise can be valuable at all levels of a business.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_060">“Focusing on Business Families,” <em class="emphasis">BDO</em>, November 2009, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://static.staging.bdo.defacto-cms.com/assets/documents/2010/04/Focusing_on_business_families.pdf">static.staging.bdo.defacto-cms.com/assets/documents/2010/04/Focusing_on _business_families.pdf</a>.</span> In addition, nonfamily members can offer stability to a family business by offering a fair and impartial perspective on business issues. The challenge is in attracting and retaining nonfamily employees because these employees “may find it difficult to deal with family conflicts on the job, limited opportunities for advancement, and the special treatment sometimes accorded family members. In addition, some family members may resent outsiders being brought into the firm and purposely make things unpleasant for nonfamily employees.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_061">“Family Owned Businesses Law and Legal Definition,” <em class="emphasis">USLegal.com</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://definitions.uslegal.com/f/family-owned-businesses">definitions.uslegal.com/f/family-owned-businesses</a>.</span> Because it is likely that a growing family business will need to hire people from the outside, it is important that the business come to terms with that necessity. Policies and procedures can help with the transition, but the most important thing is to prepare the family culture of the business to accept a nonfamily member. Not surprisingly, this is much easier said than done.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Professional Management</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p01">The decision to hire a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">professional manager</a><span class="glossdef">An external, nonfamily, nonowner manager.</span></span> is likely one of the most important and difficult hiring decisions that a family business owner will have to make. The typical definition of professional managers equates them with external, nonfamily, nonowner managers, thus declaring professional management and family management as mutually exclusive.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_062">Annika Hall and Mattias Nordqvist, “Professional Management in Family Businesses: Toward an Extended Understanding,” <em class="emphasis">Family Business Review</em> 21, no. 1 (2008): 51–69.</span> “A typical argument…is that professional nonfamily managers should be brought in to provide ‘objectivity’ and ‘rationality’ to the family firm.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_063">Annika Hall and Mattias Nordqvist, “Professional Management in Family Businesses: Toward an Extended Understanding,” <em class="emphasis">Family Business Review</em> 21, no. 1 (2008): 51–69.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p02">There are several problems with this way of thinking. First, it perpetuates the outdated notion that family members are not professional, that the smartest thing for a family business to do is to bring in professional management—as quickly as possible.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_064">Annika Hall and Mattias Nordqvist, “Professional Management in Family Businesses: Toward an Extended Understanding,” <em class="emphasis">Family Business Review</em> 21, no. 1 (2008): 51–69.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p03">Second, professional managers are not always prepared to deal with the special nature of family-owned businesses. “The influence of families on businesses they own and manage is often invisible to management theorists and business schools. The core topics of management education—organizational behavior, strategy, finance, marketing, production, and accounting—are taught without differentiating between family and nonfamily businesses.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_065">Kelin E. Gersick et al., <em class="emphasis">Generation to Generation: Life Cycles of the Family Business</em> (Cambridge, MA: Owner Managed Business Institute, Harvard Business School Press, 1997), 4.</span> This does an injustice to the unique workings of a family-owned business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p04">Third, a professional manager from the outside is not always prepared, perhaps not even most of the time, to deal with the special nature of family companies. The dominant view on professional management downplays the importance of the social and the cultural context. “This is a problem in family firms where family relations, norms, and values are crucial to the workings and development of the business.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_066">Annika Hall and Mattias Nordqvist, “Professional Management in Family Businesses: Toward an Extended Understanding,” <em class="emphasis">Family Business Review</em> 21, no. 1 (2008): 51–69.</span> It is argued that the meaning business families attach to their businesses is guided by family values and expectations—so much so that “anything or anyone that interrupts this fragility could send the business into chaos.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_067">Annika Hall and Mattias Nordqvist, “Professional Management in Family Businesses: Toward an Extended Understanding,” <em class="emphasis">Family Business Review</em> 21, no. 1 (2008): 51–69.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s06_p05">The hiring of an outside manager, therefore, should include an assessment of both <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">formal competence</a><span class="glossdef">Formal education, training, and experience outside the family business.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">cultural competence</a><span class="glossdef">An understanding of the culture of a specific firm.</span></span>. Formal competence refers to formal education, training, and experience outside the family business. Although it is certainly helpful and appropriate, formal competence is not sufficient for managerial effectiveness. It needs to be supplemented with cultural competence, an understanding of the culture of a specific firm. Interestingly, most family businesses look only to formal competence when selecting a CEO.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_068">Annika Hall and Mattias Nordqvist, “Professional Management in Family Businesses: Toward an Extended Understanding,” <em class="emphasis">Family Business Review</em> 21, no. 1 (2008): 51–69.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s02_s07_p01">One of the more difficult challenges that a family business must face is determining employment qualifications for employees, both family and nonfamily.

                <li>They consider fair compensation to be equal compensation for all family members, sometimes even for the owner. This creates a very sticky situation because all family members are not created equal. “It is sometimes difficult to assess and compare the talents of family members who are also employees. Nor do all family members contribute equally to the business. As a result of the stress that this causes, many family business owners ignore the problem and let compensation become a breeding ground for dissension in the family.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_079">Kathy Marshack, “How to Arrive at Fair Compensation in a Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">American Chronicle</em>, February 29, 2008, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/53757">www.americanchronicle.com/articles/view/53757</a>.</span>

                <li>They do not compensate wives for the work they do. The reason often given? It saves on taxes.

The average salary of the typical son in a family business was $115,000, while his sister earned only $19,000. This may be due to the tendency of sons being groomed for leadership, while daughters are groomed for the supportive roles that command lower salaries.</li>

It eases the founder’s concerns about transferring the firm to someone else and provides time in which to prepare for a major change in lifestyle. It encourages the heirs to work in the business, rather than embarking on alternative careers, because they can see what roles they will be able to play. And it endeavors to provide what is best for the business; in other words, it recognizes that managerial ability is more important than birthright, and that appointing an outside candidate may be wiser than entrusting the company to a relative who has no aptitude for the work.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_094">“Making a Difference: The PricewaterhouseCoopers Family Business Survey 2007/08,” <em class="emphasis">PriceWaterhouseCoopers</em>, November 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.pwc.com/en_TH/th/publications/assets/pwc_fbs_survey.pdf">www.pwc.com/en_TH/th/publications/assets/pwc_fbs_survey.pdf</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Establish goals and objectives.</strong> As the family business owner, you must establish your personal goals and vision for the business and your future role in its operation. You should include your retirement goals, family member goals, goals of other stakeholders (e.g., partners, shareholders, and employees), and goals relating to what should happen in the case of your illness, death, or disability.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Family involvement in the decision-making process.</strong> If the family and stakeholders who are involved in the decision-making process are kept informed of the decisions being made, many of the problems related to inheritance, management, and ownership issues will be alleviated. Communication, the process for handling family change and disputes, the family vision for the business, and the relationship between the family and the business should be addressed. The surest path to family discord is developing the succession plan on your own and then announcing it.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_098">Susan Ward, “Six Business Succession Planning Tips,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, 2011, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm</a>.</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Identify successor(s).</strong> This section of the plan will address the issue of who takes over ownership and management of the business. Identification of the potential successor(s), training of the successor(s), building support for the successor(s), and teaching the successor(s) to build vision for the business are included here. Working with your successor(s) for a year or two before you hand over the business will increase the chances for success.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_099">Susan Ward, “Six Business Succession Planning Tips,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, 2011, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/buysellabiz/a/succession1_2.htm</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Estate planning.</strong> Estate planning is important if you are planning to retire or want to take precautionary measures regarding the future of the business in the event you are unable to continue operation of the family business due to illness, disability, or death. You should consult a lawyer, an accountant, a financial/estate planner, and a life insurance representative so that your benefits will be maximized. You will need to consider taxation, retirement income, provisions for other family members, and active/nonactive family members.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Contingency planning.</strong> Contingency planning is about unforeseen circumstances. It is about strategizing for the most likely “what if” scenarios (e.g., your death or disability). By thinking in terms of the unforeseen, you will be taking a proactive rather than reactive approach.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Company structure and transfer methods.</strong> This section of the succession plan involves the review and updating of the organizational and structural plan for the organization taking into account the strengths and weaknesses of the successor. The following needs to be identified: the roles and the responsibilities of the successor, the filling of key positions, structuring of the business to fit the successor, the potential roles for the retiring owner, any legal complications, and financial issues.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Business valuation.</strong> This section is relevant only if the business is being sold. Passing the business to a family member would not involve a business valuation.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Exit strategy.</strong> With any succession, ownership will be transferred, and you will remove yourself from the day-to-day operations of the business. Alternatives will be compared, and a framework for making your final choices will be developed. The transfer method and the timelines are decided. The exit plan should then be published and distributed to everyone who is involved in the succession process.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Implementation and follow-up.</strong> The succession plan should be reviewed regularly and revised as situations change. It should be a dynamic and a flexible document.</li>
