In other words, it is about avoiding the “out of stock” situation that irritates customers. Small-business owners must understand how much inventory will be needed to address their customers’ needs on a timely basis and at the appropriate cost (think pricing strategy). High inventories are undesirable because they may lead to obsolete products, depressed sales of new models, and liquidation prices that may change customer expectations in the future.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_162">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E. Clow, <em class="emphasis">Essentials of Marketing</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 312.</span> Small businesses should think of inventory as a wasting asset: it does not improve with time and, in fact, becomes less valuable with every day that passes—taking up space and incurring heat, light, power, handling, and interest charges. Every day that shows inventory and no sales will also show no profit. The goal is to keep inventory as low as possible.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_163">“How to Run a Small Business: Inventory Management,” <em class="emphasis">StartupNation LLC</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.startupnation.com/business-articles/899/1/AT_InventoryMgt.asp">www.startupnation.com/business-articles/899/1/AT _InventoryMgt.asp</a>.</span>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Better sorting and searching.</strong> Make it easier for shoppers to find what they are looking for.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Multibrand combinations in a single cart.</strong> If multiple brands are carried, make it possible to combine shopping carts across brands and apply promotions on the entire cart.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Clarity on price and delivery rate.</strong> Prices and delivery rates should be marked clearly, with no ambiguity.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Multiple payment options.</strong> Offer more than credit cards. (See <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch04#cadden_1.0-ch04">Chapter 4 "E-Business and E-Commerce"</a> for a discussion of payment options.)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Check-out options.</strong> Do not require a customer to register before completing checkout.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Provide a product search engine.</strong> The larger and more complex the product selection, the more a product search engine is needed. Shoppers can search by product name; product type; price; product attributes, such as color, size, or material; or brand either alone or in combination.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Two clicks to buy.</strong> The fewer the number of clicks to buy, the greater the chances that a shopper will do just that.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Customer support.</strong> Offer customer support throughout the buying process. Make it easy to communicate with a real person; spell out the company’s warranty, refund, and return policies; ensure privacy and security; and let shoppers know if you put cookies on their computers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Fulfilling orders.</strong> Ideally, send each customer an e-mail confirming when the order is completed, remind the shopper to print the order details, and provide a tracking number with a direct link to the carrier’s website so that the shopper can follow the progress of shipment.</li>

                <li>A small business may choose the direct, retail, wholesale, service, or hybrid channels or some combination of these channels.</li>
                <li>In general, B2B distribution channels parallel those of B2C businesses.</li>
                <li>The direct channel involves selling to the final customer with no intermediaries involved.</li>
                <li>Service businesses use the direct channel only because services are performed and consumed at the same time.</li>
                <li>The retail channel is considered indirect because the retailer is an intermediary between the producer or manufacturer and the final customer.</li>
                <li>The wholesale channel is also an indirect channel. The wholesaler is placed between the producer or manufacturer and the retailer.</li>
                <li>The multichannel distribution system (hybrid channel) uses two or more channels to reach one or more customer segments.</li>
                <li>Logistics are about getting materials, semifinished goods, and finished goods to customers efficiently and cost effectively. They can be handled by the producer or the manufacturer, intermediaries, or the customer.</li>
                <li>Logistics include decisions related to warehousing, transportation, inventory control, and order processing. These decisions are relevant to both online and onground companies.</li>
                <li>Websites play an important role in “placing” goods and services into the hands of customers.</li>
                <li>It is important to reduce the number of customers who abandon their shopping carts (i.e., leave the website without purchasing the items in their shopping carts).</li>
                <li>Shopping cart abandonment is common among online retailers. Shoppers abandon their carts for a variety of reasons, the most important one being high shipping charges.</li>

You sell online as well as onground and have received several notes from potential online customers expressing their disappointment that you distribute the gift baskets only in the New England area. You have decided to find out what logistics would be involved in shipping to San Francisco, California; Dallas, Texas; Chicago, Illinois; and Anchorage, Alaska.
