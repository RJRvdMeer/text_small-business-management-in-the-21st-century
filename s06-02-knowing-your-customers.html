    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_p01">The perceived value proposition offers a significant challenge to any business. It requires that a business have a fairly complete understanding of the customer’s perception of benefits and costs. Although market segmentation may help a business better understand some segments of the market, the challenge is still getting to understand the customer. In many cases, customers themselves may have difficulty in clearly understanding what they perceive as the benefits and costs of any offer. How then is a business, particularly a small business, to identify this vital requirement? The simple answer is that a business must be open to every opportunity to listen to the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">voice of the customer (VOC)</a><span class="glossdef">Any and all attempts to identify the <em class="emphasis">real</em> wants and needs of a customer.</span></span>. This may involve actively talking to your customers on a one-to-one basis, as illustrated by Robert Brown, the small business owner highlighted at the beginning of this chapter. It may involve other methods of soliciting feedback from your customers, such as satisfaction surveys or using the company’s website. Businesses may engage in market research projects to better understand their customers or evaluate proposed new products and services. Regardless of what mechanism is used, it should serve one purpose—to better understand the needs and wants of your customers.</p>

Naturally, it will include significant materials on the subject of market research. In this section, the focus will be on how a business may gain better insight into what constitutes the benefits and the costs for particular customers. It will take a broad view and leave the details of market research for <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch06#cadden_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Marketing Basics"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p02">Good research in the area of customer value simply means that one must stop talking to the customer—talking through displays, advertising, and/or a website. It means that one is always open to listening carefully to the VOC. Active listening in the service of better identifying customer value means that one is always open to the question of how your business can better solve the problems of particular customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_p03">If businesses are to become better listeners, what should they be listening for? What types of questions should they be asking their customers? Businesses should address the following questions when they attempt to make customer value the focus of their existence:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s01_l01">
            <li>What needs of our customers are we currently meeting?</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Who Your Customer Is—and Is Not</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p01">At the beginning of this chapter, it was argued that your central focus must be the customer. One critical way that this might be achieved is by providing a customer with superior value. However, creating this value must be done in a way that assures that the business makes money. One way of doing this is by identifying and selecting those customers who will be profitable. Some have put forth the concept of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer lifetime value</a><span class="glossdef">A measure of the revenue generated by a customer, the cost generated for that particular customer, and the projected retention rate of that customer over his or her lifetime.</span></span>, a measure of the revenue generated by a customer, the cost generated for that particular customer, and the projected retention rate of that customer over his or her lifetime.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_019">Jack Schmid, “How Much Are Your Customers Worth?,” <em class="emphasis">Catalog Age</em> 18, no. 3 (2001): 63.</span><sup class="superscript">,</sup><span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_020">Jonathon Lee and Lawrence Feick, “Cooperating Word-of-Mouth Affection Estimating Customer Lifetime Value,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Database Marketing and Customer Strategy Management</em> 14 (2006): 29.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p02">This concept is popular enough that there are lifetime value calculator templates available on the web. The Harvard Business School created the calculator used in Exercise 2.1. It looks at the cost of acquiring a customer and then computes the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">net present value</a><span class="glossdef">A value that discounts the value of future cash flows. It recognizes the time value of money.</span></span> of the customer during his or her lifetime. Net present value discounts the value of future cash flows. It recognizes the time value of money. You can use one of two models: a simple model that examines a single product or a more complex model with additional variables. One of the great benefits in conducting customer lifetime value analysis is combining it with the notion of market segmentation. The use of market segmentation allows for recognizing that certain classes of customers may produce significantly different profits during their lifetimes. Not all customers are the same.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p03">Let us look at a simple case of segmentation based on behavioral factors. Some customers make more frequent purchases; these loyal customers may generate a disproportionate contribution of a firm’s overall profit. It has been estimated that only 15 percent of American customers have loyalty to a single retailer, yet these customers generate between 55 percent and 70 percent of retail sales.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_021">“Loyalty Promotions,” <em class="emphasis">Little &amp; King Integrated Marketing Group</em>, accessed December 5, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.littleandking.com/white_papers/loyalty_promotions.pdf">www.littleandking.com/white_papers/loyalty_promotions.pdf</a>.</span> Likewise, a lifetime-based economic analysis of different customer segments may show that certain groups of customers actually cost more than the revenues that they generate.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s02_p04">Having segmented your customers, you will probably find that some require more handholding during and after the sale. Some customer groups may need you to “tailor” your product or service to their needs.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_022">“Determining Your Customer Perspective—Can You Satisfy These Customer Segments?,” <em class="emphasis">Business901.com</em>, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://business901.com/blog1/determining-your-customer-perspective-can-you-satisfy-these-customer-segments">business901.com/blog1/determining-your-customer-perspective-can-you-satisfy-these-customer-segments</a>.</span> As previously mentioned, market segmentation can be done along several dimensions. Today, some firms use data mining to determine the basis of segmentation, but that often requires extensive databases, software, and statisticians. One simple way to segment your customers is the customer value matrix that is well suited for small retail and service businesses. It uses just three variables: recency, frequency, and monetary value. Its data requirements are basic. It needs customer identification, the date of purchase, and the total amount of purchase. This enables one to easily calculate the average purchase amount of each customer. From this, you can create programs that reach out to particular segments.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_023">Claudio Marcus, “A Practical yet Meaningful Approach to Customer Segmentation,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Consumer Marketing</em> 15, no. 5 (1998): 494.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Your Gut Tells You</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p01">The role of market research was already discussed in this chapter. For many small businesses, particularly very small businesses, formal market research may pose a problem. In many small businesses, there may be a conflict between decision making made on a professional basis and decision making made on an instinctual basis.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_024">Malcolm Goodman, “The Pursuit of Value through Qualitative Market Research,” <em class="emphasis">Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal</em> 2, no. 2 (1999): 111.</span> Some small business owners will always decide based on a gut instinct. We can point to many instances in which gut instinct concerning the possible success in product paid off, whereas a formal market research evaluation might consider the product to be a nonstarter.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p02">In 1975, California salesman Gary Dahl came up with the idea of the ideal pet—a pet that would require minimal care and cost to maintain. He developed the idea of the pet rock. This unlikely concept became a fad and a great success for Dahl. Ken Hakuta, also known as Dr. Fad, developed a toy known as the Wallwalker in 1983. It sold over 240 million units.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_025">“What Are Wacky WallWalkers?,” <em class="emphasis">DrFad.com</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.drfad.com/fad_facts/wallwalker.htm">www.drfad.com/fad_facts/wallwalker.htm</a>.</span> These and other fad products, such as the Cabbage Patch dolls and Rubik’s Cube, are so peculiar that one would be hard pressed to think of any marketing research that would have indicated that they would be viable, let alone major successes.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p03">Sometimes it is an issue of having a product idea and knowing where the correct market for the product will be. Jill Litwin created <em class="emphasis">Peas a Pie Pizza</em>, which is a natural food pizza pie with vegetables baked in the crust. She knew that the best place to market her unique product would be in the San Francisco area with its appreciation of organic foods.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_026">Susan Smith Hendrickson, “Mining Her Peas and Carrots Wins Investors,” <em class="emphasis">Mississippi Business Journal</em> 32, no. 21 (2010): S4.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s03_p04">This notion of going with one’s gut instinct is not limited to fad products. Think of the birth of Apple Computer. The objective situation was dealing with a company whose two major executives were college dropouts. The business was operating out of the garage of the mother of one of these two executives. They were producing a product that up to that point had only a limited number of hobbyists as a market. None of this would add up to very attractive prospect for investment. You could easily envision a venture capitalist considering a possible investment asking for a market research study that would identify the target market(s) for its computers. None existed at the company’s birth. Even today, there is a strong indication that Apple does not rely heavily on formal marketing research. As Steve Jobs put it,</p>

It is an approach that was initially developed in Japan for manufacturing applications. It seeks “to transform user demands into design quality, to deploy the functions forming quality, and to deploy methods for achieving the design quality into subsystems and component parts, and ultimately to specific elements.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_028">Yoji Akao, <em class="emphasis">Quality Function Deployment: Integrating Customer Requirements into Product Design</em> (New York: Productivity Press, 1990), 17.</span> To put it more clearly, QFD takes the desires of consumers and explores how well the individual activities of the business are meeting those desires. It also considers how company activities interact with each other and how well the company is meeting those customer desires with respect to the competition. It achieves all these ends through the means of a schematic; see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s04_f01">Figure 2.4 "House of Quality"</a>, which is known as the house of quality. The schematic provides the backbone for the entire QFD process. A comprehensive design process may use several houses of quality, moving from the first house, which concentrates on the initial specification of customer desires, all the way down to developing a house that focuses on the specification for parts or processes. Any house is composed of several components:</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">How to Become a Better Listener</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p01">Although some succeed by listening to their instincts—their inner voices—it is highly advisable to all businesses to be proactive in trying to listen to the VOC. Listening to the customer is the domain of market research. However, it should not be surprising that many small businesses have severe resource constraints that make it difficult for them to use complex and sophisticated marketing and market research approaches.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_031">David Carson, Stanley Cromie, Pauric McGowan, Jimmy Hill, <em class="emphasis">Marketing and Entrepreneurship in Small and Midsize Enterprises</em> (Hemel Hempstead, UK: Prentice-Hall, 1995), 108.</span> To some extent, this is changing with the introduction of powerful, yet relatively low cost, web-based tools and social media. These will be discussed in greater detail in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch02_s04#cadden_1.0-ch02_s04_s02">Section 2.4.2 "Digital Technology and E-Environment Implications"</a> of this chapter. Another restriction that a small business may face in the area of marketing is that the owner’s marketing skills and knowledge may not be very extensive. The owners of such firms may opt for several types of solutions. They may try to mimic the marketing techniques employed by larger organizations, drawing on what was just mentioned. They may opt for sophisticated but easy to use analytical tools, or they may just simply take marketing tools and techniques and apply them to the small business environment.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_032">Malcolm Goodman, “The Pursuit of Value through Qualitative Market Research,” <em class="emphasis">Qualitative Market Research: An International Journal</em> 2, no. 2 (1999): 111.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p02">The most basic and obvious way to listen to customers is by talking to them. All businesses should support programs in which employees talk to customers and then record what they have to say about the product or the service. It is important to centralize these observations.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_p03">Other ways of listening to customers are through comment cards and paper and online surveys. These approaches have their strengths and limitations (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch02_s02_s05_n01">Note 2.31 "Video Clip 2.11"</a>). Regardless of these limitations, they do provide an insight into your customers. Another way one can gather information about customers is through loyalty programs. Loyalty programs are used by 81 percent of US households.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn02_033">Shallee Fitzgerald, “It’s in the Cards,” <em class="emphasis">Canadian Grocer</em> 118, no. 10 (2004/2005): 30.</span> Social media options—see <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch02_s04#cadden_1.0-ch02_s04_s02">Section 2.4.2 "Digital Technology and E-Environment Implications"</a>—offer a tremendous opportunity to not only listen to your customer but also engage in an active dialog that can build a sustainable relationship with customers.</p>

            <p class="para">This is the fourth in a series of videos on listening to customers. This video covers how to analyze any disengaged or disgruntled customers. Once a customer is identified, our process ensures that action is taken to reengage the customer by dealing with the concerns at hand. But most importantly, the process encourages the development of a relationship between the customer and branch level management.</p>
