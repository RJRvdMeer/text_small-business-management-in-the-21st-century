        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_p01">Anita Bruscino, the sole proprietor of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://elegantouchfinegifts.net">Elegant Touch</a>, began her career as a mechanical engineer. She worked in her family’s manufacturing business until she and her father left because of too many factions in the company. This provided her with the opportunity to start her own business, something she had always known in her heart that she wanted to do.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_p02">Anita was inspired to open a gift shop by a family friend who had owned her own gift shop. She gave Anita advice on starting her own business, and Elegant Touch opened in 1994. Anita has since expanded the business and is celebrating the shop’s eighteenth anniversary, with the last six years in its larger location. The shop is warm, lovely, and comfortable, featuring unique gifts for all occasions and specializing in American handcrafted gift items and gift baskets. Shoppers will also find maternity gifts, items for the sweet tooth, specialty foods, special seasonal sections<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_001">Leslie Hutchison, “Elegant Touch Fine Gifts,” <em class="emphasis">CheshirePatch</em>, accessed March 24, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://cheshire.patch.com/listings/elegant-touch-fine-gifts">cheshire.patch.com/listings/elegant-touch-fine-gifts</a>.</span>—and a friendly smile from Anita. One thing that you will not find at Elegant Touch is what you find in other gift shops in her market area. When selecting products for her shop, Anita asks vendors whether other stores in the area carry the gift line she is considering. She will not carry duplicates. She likes to see new things and follows the trade magazines to help her do that. When asked how she chooses the products to carry, she described the process as instinctive—“from the gut.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_p03">Anita describes her customer demographics as mostly women, between thirty and seventy years old, married, and established with a home. Because many of her customers are repeat customers, the reason for fresh products is clear. A stale product line is not something that she can afford. Her pricing strategy is consistent with common practice in the industry, but many of her customers have commented that she delivers very high value for the prices she charges. She is not interested in selling online because she does not want to expand any further. She is at a nice comfort level and does not want to deal with the additional inventory implications or the need to hire additional employees. As a result, the Elegant Touch website is for basic information only. In promoting Elegant Touch, Anita says that word of mouth works the best. She advertises in the local paper occasionally, supports local events, and is preparing for her first e-mail blast. She is exploring a Facebook presence but is not yet convinced that it will be of much value to her business.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_p04">Like all small businesses, Elegant Touch has been impacted by the ups and downs in the economy, with some times being tougher than others. Because Anita has only two part-time employees, however, she has not been faced with the employee layoffs that have hit other small companies. When asked what keeps her going in the rough times, she answered, “You have to love it.” Just walk into her gift shop, and you will see clearly that she does.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_002">Except for the content from CheshirePatch.com, all information herein is based on an interview with Anita Bruscino, owner of Elegant Touch, March 2, 2012.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s01_p01">Small-business marketing and big business marketing are not the same. The basic marketing principles that guide both are the same, but there are important differences with respect to scope, budget, risk factors, and areas of opportunity.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_003">Lynne Saarte, “Small Business Marketing Is Different from Big Business Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Articlecity</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.articlecity.com/articles/marketing/article_4959.shtml">www.articlecity.com/articles/marketing/article_4959.shtml</a>; Lyndon David, “Small Business Marketing Strategy: How Different Is It from Larger Businesses?,” <em class="emphasis">Slideshare</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/lyndondavid/small-business-marketing-strategy-how-different-is-it-from-larger-businesses">www.slideshare.net/lyndondavid/small-business-marketing-strategy-how-different -is-it-from-larger-businesses</a>.</span> (See <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch06#cadden_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Marketing Basics"</a> for a discussion of marketing principles.) Small businesses cannot compete with the marketing budgets of big companies. As a result, small businesses do not have the luxury of large staffs and the staying power that comes with high profits. There is little room for error. Failed strategies can lead to ruin.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s01_p02">The scope of small business marketing does not extend across the same level of multiple products and services that characterize most big businesses. Combined with having few if any products in the pipeline, this significantly reduces the insulation that small businesses have against ups and downs in the marketplace or strategic failures. “Small business marketing strategies have to be more targeted, cost-effective and more elaborately planned [s]o as to minimize the losses in case the strategy fails.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_004">Lyndon David, “Small Business Marketing Strategy: How Different Is It from Larger Businesses?,” <em class="emphasis">Slideshare</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/lyndondavid/small-business-marketing-strategy-how-different-is-it-from-larger-businesses">www.slideshare.net/lyndondavid/small-business-marketing-strategy-how-different-is-it-from-larger -businesses</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s01_p03">Competition is the most significant risk factor facing small businesses. Trying to eliminate an established brand takes a lot of work, but it is an overnight job to wipe out a small business. Competition is a huge threat for small businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_005">Lyndon David, “Small Business Marketing Strategy: How Different Is It from Larger Businesses?,” <em class="emphasis">Slideshare</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.slideshare.net/lyndondavid/small-business-marketing-strategy-how-different-is-it-from-larger-businesses">www.slideshare.net/lyndondavid/small-business-marketing-strategy-how-different-is-it-from-larger -businesses</a>.</span> This means that small businesses should be very knowledgeable about their competition to deal effectively with them.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s01_p04">Opportunity areas for small businesses are also very different from those of big businesses. The small business can take advantage of niche markets and local needs and wants. They are much better able to emphasize personal, one-to-one interactions and can market real time in ways that cannot be matched by big businesses. Smaller can actually end up being more powerful.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_006">Ann Handley, “Act Your Shoe Size, Not Your Age: 3 Ways to Market Smaller in 2011,” <em class="emphasis">MarketingProfs</em>, January 3, 2011, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mpdailyfix.com/3-ways-to-market-smaller-in-2011">www.mpdailyfix.com/3-ways-to-market-smaller-in-2011</a>.</span></p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_p01">The focus of this text is on the management of the small business that is up and running as opposed to a start-up operation. As a result, the considerations of marketing strategy are twofold: (1) to modify or tweak marketing efforts already in place and (2) to add products or services as the business evolves. In some instances, it may be appropriate and desirable for a small business to backfit its marketing activities into a complete marketing strategy framework.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_p02">The marketing strategy process consists of several components (<a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_f01">Figure 7.1 "Marketing Strategy Process"</a>). Each component should be considered and designed carefully: company vision, company mission, marketing objectives, and the marketing strategy itself.</p>

They lay the groundwork for formulating the marketing strategy. Although formulated in a variety of ways, their achievement should lead to sales.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p01">With its focus being on achieving the marketing objectives, marketing strategy involves segmenting the market and selecting a target or targets, making differentiation and positioning decisions, and designing the marketing mix. The design of the product (one of the four Ps) will include design of the company website. Differentiation refers to a company’s efforts to set its product or service apart from the competition, and positioning is placing the brand (whether store, product, or service) in the consumer’s mind in relation to other competing products based on product traits and benefits that are relevant to the consumer.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_018">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E.

It involves recognizing that the market at large is not homogeneous.</span></span>, dividing a market into relatively homogeneous subgroups that behave much the same way in the marketplace, is the necessary precursor to selecting a target market or target markets.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Measurability.</strong> Is it easy to identify and estimate the size of a segment? A small business that moves forward without a clear definition of its market segments is working blind. Intuition can only go so far. Are there people who are interested in freshly baked cookies for dogs (it would seem so), and how many of these people are there? (Check out <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.happyheartsdogcookies.com">Happy Hearts Dog Cookies</a>.)</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Substantiality.</strong> Is the segment large and profitable enough to justify an investment? A small business may not require a huge number of customers to be profitable, but there should be enough people interested in the product or the service being offered to make operating the business worthwhile. Fancy designer clothes for dogs, for example, is a business that can survive—but not everywhere (see <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ralphlauren.com/search/index.jsp?kw=pup&amp;f=Home">www.ralphlauren.com/search/index.jsp?kw=pup&amp;f=Home</a>).</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stability.</strong> Stability has to do with consumer preferences. Are they stable over time? Although segments will change over time, a small business needs to be aware of preferences that are continuously changing. Small businesses can be more nimble at adapting their businesses to change, but too much volatility can be damaging to a business’s operations.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Accessibility.</strong> Can a business communicate with and reach the segment? A small business interested in women who work outside the home will present greater communication challenges than will stay-at-home wives and mothers.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Actionability.</strong> Is a small business capable of designing an effective marketing program that can serve the chosen market segment? There was a small manufacturer of low-priced cigarettes in Virginia that found it difficult to compete with the big brands and other established lower-priced brands such as Bailey’s. The manufacturer’s solution was to sell to Russia where “Made in Virginia, USA” worked very well with customers and retailers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_021">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E. Clow, <em class="emphasis">Essentials of Marketing</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 176.</span>
</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Differential response.</strong> The extent to which market segments are easily distinguishable from each other and respond differently to company marketing strategies.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_022">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E. Clow, <em class="emphasis">Essentials of Marketing</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 176.</span> For the small business that chooses only one segment, this is not an issue. However, the small manufacturer of ramen noodles in New York City needs to know whether there are different segments for the product and whether the marketing strategy will appeal to those segments in the same positive way.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s03_s01_p03">Once multiple segments have been identified, it is necessary to select a target market or target markets. If only a single segment has been identified, it becomes the target market.</p>

(In <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch06#cadden_1.0-ch06">Chapter 6 "Marketing Basics"</a>, a target market refers to one or more segments that have been chosen as the focus for business operations.) Only some of the people in the marketplace will be interested in buying and/or using a company’s product or service, and no company has the resources to be all things to all people. Resources are always finite, but this will especially be the case for the small business, so all marketing efforts should be directed as precisely as possible.</p>

A niche market is a small, more narrowly defined market that is not being served well or at all by mainstream product or service marketers. The great advantage of pursuing a niche market is that you are likely to be alone there: “other small businesses may not be aware of your particular niche market, and large businesses won’t want to bother with it.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_024">Susan Ward, “Niche Market,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/marketing/g/nichemarket.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/marketing/g/nichemarket.htm</a>.</span> Ideally, a small business marketing to a niche market will be the only one doing so.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p01">Positioning is about the mind of the consumer: placing a company or a brand (sometimes they are the same, e.g., Carbonite, CakeLove, and Sugar Bakery &amp; Sweet Shop) in the consumer’s mind in relation to the competition.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_032">Al Ries and Jack Trout, <em class="emphasis">Positioning: The Battle for Your Mind</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2001), 3.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p02">The positioning decision is often the critical strategic decision for a company or a brand because the position can be central to customers’ perception and choice decisions. Further, because all elements of the marketing program can potentially affect the position, it is usually necessary to use a positioning strategy as a focus for developing the marketing program. A clear positioning strategy can ensure that the elements of the marketing program are consistent and supportive.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_033">David A.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s04_s02_p03">Both big and small businesses practice positioning, but small businesses may not know it as positioning. The small business owner thinks about positioning intuitively, does not use the terminology, and does not always know how to promote the position. Additionally, in many if not most small businesses, “the positioning of products is based on the opinions of the business owner, his or her family, and selected friends and family.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_034">“Product Positioning,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/encyclopedia/product-positioning.html">www.inc.com/encyclopedia/product-positioning.html</a>.</span> This notwithstanding, an understanding of positioning should be in every small business owner’s tool kit.</p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by price/quality.</strong> A very pervasive approach to positioning. Some small companies and brands offer more in terms of service, features, or performance, and a higher price serves to signal this higher quality to the customer. As an example, Derry Church Artisan Chocolates are very expensive, but they position themselves as having the very high quality that justifies a high price.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_036">Jim T.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by use or application.</strong> Focuses on how a product is used or different applications of the product. A solitary custom tailoring shop located in a downtown professional office area could position itself as the only tailor where you can conveniently go “for lunch.”</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Positioning by product user.</strong> The focus shifts from the product to the user. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kindsnacks.com/">KIND Snacks</a> are cereal bars positioned as a snack bar for those who are interested in a snack that is wholesome, convenient, tasty, healthy, and “economically sustainable and socially impactful.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_037">“Our Story,” <em class="emphasis">KIND Healthy Snacks</em>, accessed December 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.kindsnacks.com/our-story">www.kindsnacks.com/our-story</a>.</span> It is a great snack for hikers and campers.</li>
            <li>

The product layers should also be used to develop new products that the business plans to introduce.</p>

The designer must figure out how much to invest in form, feature development, performance, conformance, durability, reliability, repairability, and style. To the company, a well-designed product is one that is easy to manufacture and distribute. To the customer, a well-designed product is one that is pleasant to look at and easy to open, install, use, repair, and dispose of. The designer must take all these factors into account.</p>

Some of the design issues for services that are delivered in a store (e.g., dry cleaning, repair, and restaurant) are the same as for any retail store: the design of the physical space, the appearance of the personnel, the helpfulness of the personnel, the ease of ordering, and the quality of service delivery. For services that are performed at a customer’s home or at a business site, the design issues include timeliness; the appearance and helpfulness of personnel; the quality of installation, service, and repair; and the ease of ordering the service.

Accounting practices change, people’s tastes change, hardware solutions change, and government regulation inserts itself. What is successful today may not be successful tomorrow.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s05_s07_p01">A company’s website is part of its product or service. The conventional wisdom is that all businesses should have a website. The reality is that there are many small businesses that do very well for themselves without a web presence. The small local deli, accounting or insurance services, a legal firm, a liquor store, or a dental office may not see the need for a website. At the same time, customers are increasingly expecting a web presence, so any small business that does not have a website runs the risk of losing sales because of it. The time may also be approaching when not having a website will be perceived as odd, with questions raised as to the seriousness of the business. Every small business without a website should determine whether this matters to them or not.</p>

                    <li>Frank’s All-American BarBeQue is planning to significantly expand its takeout business. Currently, customers come into the restaurant and order from the menu. With the new Darien facility and website, customers will be able to order online or fax an order to the restaurant. Frank and Robert have been arguing over how to structure the takeout portion of their operations. Frank wants to maintain the approach where customers order items from the menu. Robert believes that in today’s world, it would be more convenient for customers to order complete prepackaged meals. Father and son have argued about the nature of these meals. Frank has suggests a limited number of standard meals that could be prepared during the day and sold in the evening when commuters are returning home. However, this might mean that excess inventory would be built up on unwanted items. Robert wants to offer greater variety. These would include a main course, two side dishes, and a dessert. Because there could be a large number of combinations, most would have to be made after the receipt of an order. The “rush” to make these meals would drive up costs. How would you go about pricing these two types of meals?</li>

The costs will vary by several factors (e.g., industry sector, company location, and company size). Retailers that offer a wide assortment of products will spend more on logistics because transportation and storage costs will increase as the number of carried products increases.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_158">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E.

In other words, it is about avoiding the “out of stock” situation that irritates customers. Small-business owners must understand how much inventory will be needed to address their customers’ needs on a timely basis and at the appropriate cost (think pricing strategy). High inventories are undesirable because they may lead to obsolete products, depressed sales of new models, and liquidation prices that may change customer expectations in the future.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_162">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Entice reluctant customers.</strong> Giving away a free product or service is usually a good way to get people to try a product or a service for the first time, the hope being that it will lead to a purchase.

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Building product awareness.</strong> A salesperson should educate customers and consumers on new product offerings.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Creating interest.</strong> Because personal selling is a person-to-person, and often a face-to-face, communication, it is a natural way for getting customers and consumers to experience a product for the first time. Creating interest goes hand-in-hand with building product awareness.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Providing information.</strong> A large part of the conversation with the customer focuses on product information.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Stimulating demand.</strong> The most important objective of personal selling by far is persuading customers and consumers to make a purchase.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Reinforcing the brand.</strong> Most personal selling focuses on building long-term relationships with customers and consumers. However, strong relationships can be built only over time, and they require regular communication.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p03">Like all other forms of marketing communications, personal selling offers both advantages and disadvantages. On the plus side, personal selling is flexible and dynamic, providing companies with the best opportunity to tailor a message to satisfy customers’ needs. Personal selling’s interactive nature also makes it the most effective promotional method for building relationships with customers, particularly in the B2B market, and it is the most practical promotional method for reaching customers who are not easily reached through other methods.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_224">“Advantages of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/advantages-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/advantages -of-personal-selling</a>.</span> Personal selling can help a small business build strong, loyal relationships with customers and consumers.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p04">On the minus side, the biggest disadvantage may be the negative perceptions that many people have of salespeople: pushy, annoying, slippery, and willing to do anything for the sale—whether legal or not. The reality, of course, is that most salespeople (unfortunately, not all) do not fit this stereotype. The successful salesperson is the person who focuses his or her efforts on satisfying customers over the long term as opposed to his or her own selfish interests. Also on the negative side is the high cost of personal selling. Personal sales contacts are very expensive, with the costs incurred (compensation plus sales support) whether the sale is made or not.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_225">“Disadvantages of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling</a>.</span> Then there are the costs of training the sales staff on product knowledge, industry information, and perhaps selling skills.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_226">“Disadvantages of Personal Selling,” <em class="emphasis">KnowThis.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling">www.knowthis.com/principles-of-marketing-tutorials/personal-selling/disadvantages-of-personal-selling</a>.</span> Depending on the size of the company, small businesses will have varying numbers of salespeople, so some of the costs will vary as well.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_p05">The traditional sales process is typically seen as a series of six steps:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_227">John M. Ivancevich and Thomas N. Duening, <em class="emphasis">Business Principles, Guidelines, and Practices</em> (Mason, OH: Thomson Learning, 2007), 435; Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 560–561; Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E.

            <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s08_s02_s07_l02">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Prospecting and qualifying.</strong> Locating potential customers who have a need for a product and the ability to pay for it. For example, prospects for a small electric motor company would be all the businesses that use small electric motors. Prospects can be found through a variety of sources, including current customers, trade directories, business associates, and newspaper or magazine articles.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Preapproach.</strong> It is important to learn as much about a prospect as you can. For example, you want to know about the prospect’s needs, attitudes about available products and brands, critical product attributes and benefits desired, and current vendor(s).</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Presentation and demonstration.</strong> This is where the salesperson tells the product “story” to the buyer: the product’s features, advantages, benefits, and value. It is important not to spend too much time on product features because benefits and value will most directly influence the purchase decision. It is also important to ask questions and listen carefully to a prospect’s answers because they will provide valuable insights into the prospect’s needs.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Overcoming objections.</strong> You should expect customers to pose objections. The key to overcoming these objections is to maintain a positive approach, ask the prospect to clarify the objections, and respond to the objections by reiterating the major benefits of the product or the service and pointing out additional features, guarantees, service, and anything else that would address the objections.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Closing.</strong> This is when the salesperson asks the prospect to buy the product. The request can be direct, or the salesperson can encourage the purchase by using a trial closing approach like asking, “Would you like us to finance product A for you?” Closing the sale is understandably the most difficult step for many salespeople because of the fear that the prospect will say no.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Follow-up and maintenance.</strong> These activities are necessary for customer satisfaction and repeat business. They are key to establishing the strong long-term relationships that every small business desires and needs. The salesperson should schedule a follow-up call to ensure proper installation, instruction, servicing, and troubleshooting and resolution should any problems be detected. Always remember that unhappy customers will defect to competition—and they will spread negative comments about the company. Because it is much cheaper to retain an old customer than to obtain new ones, it is in a company’s best interests to provide good follow-up and maintenance services.</li>
            </ol>

Web searches and online content help prospective customers or clients do their own prospecting and qualifying. This eliminates the most time-consuming part of the traditional sales process. A company’s website becomes the first sales presentation and, as a result, is critical in moving a prospect toward a sale. In short, all employees must be fully integrated into web marketing because web marketing is the primary driver of the sales process.

                    <li>Promotion and marketing communications are relatively synonymous terms.</li>

                    <li>There are multiple categories of IMC objectives.</li>
                    <li>The marketing communications mix for a small business will consist of some combination of advertising, sales promotion, events and experiences, PR and publicity, direct marketing, interactive marketing, and personal selling. This mix is applicable to both pure-play and brick-and-click businesses.</li>
                    <li>There is a lot of hype about blogs and social media. They can be very effective, but they have not worked well for all small businesses that have used them. They should be considered carefully before inclusion in a company’s IMC strategy.</li>

Harmon and Greg Laird, “Linking Marketing Strategy to Customer Value: Implications for Technology Marketers,” <em class="emphasis">PDFCast.org</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://pdfcast.org/pdf/linking-marketing-strategy-to-customer-value-implications-for-technology-marketers">pdfcast.org/pdf/linking-marketing-strategy-to-customer-value-implications-for -technology-marketers</a>.</span> Marketing strategy provides that strong link.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s01_p02">A customer’s decision to buy will always be contingent on the strategic effectiveness of the marketing mix: the ability of the product or the service to meet the needs, wants, and desires of the customer; a price that is attractive when compared with possible alternatives; the availability of the product or the service in an onground or online place that is in sync with the customer’s needs; and an integrated marketing communications (IMC) program that creates awareness, provides information, and persuades. Although the different elements of the marketing mix will be of differing importance depending on the customer and the situation, it all begins with the product. Well-designed and well-made products will usually come out ahead on the customer value scale. Innovative channels of distribution, such as Redbox for DVDs, gourmet and ethnic food carts, kiosks in airports for selling small electronics products, and conducting financial transactions on a smartphone, can all add to customer value. Social media as a part of the IMC mix can be a particularly great way to create customer value because a consumer’s social network can be used as a communication channel to spread the word about a product’s characteristics, quality, benefits, and value.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_232">Angela Hausman, “Marketing Strategy: Using Social Media to Create Customer Value,” <em class="emphasis">Hausman Marketing Letter</em>, October 25, 2010, accessed June 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hausmanmarketingletter.com/marketing-strategy-using-social-media-to-create-customer-value">http://www.hausmanmarketingletter.com/marketing-strategy-using-social-media-to -create-customer-value</a>.</span> Salespeople also create value for customers by helping to identify creative and cost-effective solutions to customer problems, making the customer buying process easier, and creating a positive customer experience. Pricing is always tricky, but there should be a clear and positive link between the price that customers pay and what customers see as the value received in return.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s02_p01">An efficient and effective marketing strategy will keep costs down and stimulate sales. A small business owner could not ask for more as a way to realize a positive cash flow. However, the reality is that things will not go as planned most of the time, and this will wreak havoc with cash flow. This means that the marketing strategy should be developed and implemented within the context of a cash-flow strategy so that when things do not go as planned, you can make appropriate adjustments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s02_p02">One of the biggest temptations for creating cash flow when money is tight is cutting the price as a way to stimulate sales. Think very carefully before doing this. The price reduction may generate more sales, but you may send unintended negative signals to customers about quality and value. You may also trigger a price cut by competitors that eliminates the benefits of your own price cut. A better strategy would be to maintain the price and offer the customer more value—as long as that additional value does not end up costing you more in money in the long run.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_233">Mark Hunter, “Discounting to Create Cash Flow?

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p05">You run a small, specialized electronics firm that produces unique and highly sophisticated products. Your sales are evenly split between military contracts and commercial aviation. Two years ago, during a recent economic downturn, your business was under considerable cost pressure. To reduce costs, you switched from two American-based suppliers to a Taiwanese manufacturer. Last week, a national newspaper released a story that revealed that this Taiwanese manufacturer was using counterfeit chips produced in mainland China. This is clearly illegal, but things were made even worse by the speculation that the Chinese-made chips might be mechanisms that could be used in cyber warfare. It looks as though there will be at least one congressional investigation that will examine the national security issues associated with the counterfeit chips. Unfortunately, your firm was prominently mentioned in the article as one of the firms that had purchased a large number of these chips. This could have a major impact on a firm of your size.</p>

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p06">Robert has spent the last year building his Internet business. He registered his domain name shortly after developing his idea. Three months were then spent waiting for his web developer to create a custom website built to his specifications. Just when Robert thought his online venture was going to die on the vine, his web guru called to ask if Robert wanted to see the site.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p07">Robert quickly typed in the URL of his domain. There, for all to see, was his website. The online catalog was complete, the merchant account had been set up—and has been for two weeks because he has been paying the monthly fees in anticipation of the site launch date. The e-mail at the domain is configured, and Robert’s online business is underway.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p08">Search engine optimization helps to drive traffic to Robert’s site. He sends out e-mail messages to everyone on his mailing list to let them know that his online venture is now open for business. Sales started slowly, as expected, but they grew steadily. The twenty-third sale was as exciting as the first.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p09">On the morning of the business’s one-year anniversary since buying his domain name, Robert goes to the office and turns on his computer with thoughts of checking his e-mail. His e-mail program announces an error. Something about “could not connect to server.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p10">Robert’s first thought was that perhaps the hosting company was having a network issue. He decides to wait for half an hour…but gets the same error. He decides to wait another ten minutes and try again. If it still does not work then, he plans to call his hosting company.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p11">Ten minutes go by. The error keeps showing up. One more try. The error pops up again. Robert picks up the phone and calls the hosting company. Once he gets a tech on the phone, he explains the situation, saying that he needs his e-mail up and running so that he can follow up on the orders that came into the store last night. The next ten minutes are spent double-checking settings on the e-mail program. Still nothing works.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s09_s03_p12">Eventually, someone at the hosting company thinks to check the domain name. <strong class="emphasis bold">DISASTER!</strong> The domain name had expired at midnight. No business can be conducted, and some people may think he has gone out of business.</p>
