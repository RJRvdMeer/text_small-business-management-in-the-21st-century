        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_p01">Growing up in the 1970s, Bruce and Mark Becker loved ice cream. Their Grandpa Max used to create all different kinds of ice cream for Grandma Mina and the boys to try. Grandpa was an organic chemist and loved to create some interesting flavors. Years later, after Grandpa Max passed away, Bruce was cleaning out his grandpa’s house and discovered his secret book of recipes.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_p02">And so it began.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_p03">In the 1980s, Bruce started on his journey and traveled throughout Europe and the United States doing gourmet ice cream research. With all the new information gathered and the treasure trove of Grandpa Max’s secret recipes, Bruce and Mark opened Max and Mina’s Ice Cream in 1997 in a shopping center next to Shimon’s Pizza Falafel Dairy Restaurant in Flushing, Queens, New York. They test marketed their recipes directly to the public. The public loved it—and so did the local restaurants and party planners.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_p04">Max and Mina’s Ice Cream revolutionized America’s favorite dessert with daring ingredients and bold innovation. Their unique ability to intrigue and challenge old notions of mundane flavors draws unbelievable attention at home in New York and around the globe. The most distant customer of note was from Australia, someone who insisted on going to Max and Mina’s right off the plane at Kennedy Airport.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_p05">The Beckers make their ice cream products with at least 16 percent butterfat, putting them into the gourmet category. All their ice creams are kosher, but some products adhere to even stricter dairy guidelines. The shop itself features an array of posters, a display of Wacky Packages bubblegum stickers, candy wrappers, a Jerry Garcia etching, and old-fashioned signs.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_p06">A visit to Max and Mina’s will be an unusual ice cream experience (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch06_n02">Note 6.2 "Video Clip 6.1"</a>). If you dare to take the plunge, why not try unforgettable flavors like beer, lox, babka, corn-on-the-cob, ketchup, garlic, or merlot—just to mention a few? There are also many of the more traditional flavors that you know and love. There is a rotating menu of one thousand flavors, but only about forty ice cream flavors and eight to ten sorbets are available at any one time. Bruce and Mark constantly encourage their patrons to be vocal in brainstorming new flavors, especially flavors that compliment events. Turkey ice cream, anyone? Have an idea? Stop by and give Max and Mina’s a try.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_001">“About Us,” <em class="emphasis">Max and Mina’s Ice Cream</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.maxandminasicecream.com/about.html">www.maxandminasicecream.com/about.html</a>; Miriam Hill, “1000 Flavors and a Little Romance,” <em class="emphasis">Philadelphia Inquirer</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.maxandminasicecream.com/images/articles/4.jpg">www.maxandminasicecream.com/images/articles/4.jpg</a>; John Hyland, “Lox in a Cone: Sliced Thin It’s Not,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, August 16, 2000, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.maxandminasicecream.com/images/articles/1.jpg">www.maxandminasicecream.com/images/articles/1.jpg</a>.</span></p>

Marketing is also about promotional activities such as advertising and sales that let customers know about the goods and services that are available for purchase. Successful marketing generates revenue that pays for all other company operations. Without marketing, no business can last very long. It is that important and that simple—and it applies to small business.</p>

Such a simple definition can be misleading, however, because the creation of customer value will always be a challenge—most notably because a company must know its customers extremely well to offer them what they need and want. This is complicated because customers could be seeking <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">functional value</a><span class="glossdef">A product or a service performs a utilitarian purpose.</span></span> (a product or a service performs a utilitarian purpose), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social value</a><span class="glossdef">A sense of relationship with other groups through images or symbols.</span></span> (a sense of relationship with other groups through images or symbols), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotional value</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to evoke an emotional or an affective response.</span></span> (the ability to evoke an emotional or an affective response), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">epistemic value</a><span class="glossdef">Offering novelty or fun.</span></span> (offering novelty or fun), or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conditional value</a><span class="glossdef">Derived from a particular context or a sociocultural setting, such as shared holidays.</span></span> (derived from a particular context or a sociocultural setting, such as shared holidays)—or some combination of these types of value.

Your favorite website can offer free shipping for Christmas purchases and/or pay for returns. Zappos.com offers free shipping both ways for its shoes.

A target market is one or more segments (e.g., income or income + gender + occupation) that have been chosen as the focus for business operations. The selection of a target market is important to any small business because it enables the business to be more precise with its marketing efforts, thereby being more cost-effective. This will increase the chances for success. The idea behind a target market is that it will be the best match for a company’s products and services. This, in turn, will help maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of a company’s marketing efforts:</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p02">It is not feasible to go after all customers, because customers have different wants, needs and tastes. Some customers want to be style leaders. They will always buy certain styles and usually pay a high price for them. Other customers are bargain hunters. They try to find the lowest price. Obviously, a company would have difficulty targeting both of these market segments simultaneously with one type of product. For example, a company with premium products would not appeal to bargain shoppers…</p>

More commonly known as “the four Ps,” the traditional marketing mix refers to the combination of product, price, promotion, and place (distribution). Each component is controlled by the company, but they are all affected by factors both internal and external to the company. Additionally, each element of the marketing mix is impacted by decisions made for the other elements. What this means is that an alteration of one element in the marketing mix will likely alter the other elements as well. They are inextricably interrelated. No matter the size of the business or organization, there will always be a marketing mix. The marketing mix is discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch07#cadden_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Marketing Strategy"</a>. A brief overview is presented here.</p>

Examples of product decisions include design and styling, sizes, variety, packaging, warranties and guarantees, ingredients, quality, safety, brand name and image, brand logo, and support services. In the case of a services business, product decisions also include the design and delivery of the service, with delivery including such things as congeniality, promptness, and efficiency.

Although the exchange of money is what we traditionally consider as price, time and convenience should also be considered.

Channel pricing occurs when different prices are charged depending on where the customer purchases the product. A paper manufacturer may charge different prices for paper purchased by businesses, school bookstores, and local stationery stores. Customer segment pricing refers to charging different prices for different groups. A local museum may charge students and senior citizens less for admission.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_014">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 401.</span></p>

                <li>Marketing is a distinguishing, unique function of a business.</li>
                <li>Marketing is about delivering value and benefits, creating products and services that will meet the needs and wants of customers (perhaps even delighting them) at a price they are willing to pay and in places where they are willing to buy them. It is also about promotion, getting the word out that the product or the service exists.</li>
                <li>The marketing concept has guided business practice since the 1950s.</li>
                <li>Customer value is the difference between perceived benefits and perceived costs. There are different types of customer value: functional, social, epistemic, emotional, and conditional.</li>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">It is very important in marketing to distinguish between the customer and the consumer. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer</a><span class="glossdef">The person or the business that actually buys a product or a service.</span></span>, the person or the business that actually buys a product or a service, will determine whether a business succeeds or fails. It is that simple. It does not matter one iota if a business thinks its product or service is the greatest thing since sliced bread if no one wants to buy it. This is why customers play such a central role in marketing, with everything revolving around their needs, wants, and desires. We see the customer focus in the marketing concept, and we see it in the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_p02">The marketing mix should follow the determination of customer needs, wants, and desires. However, there are instances in which a product is created before the target market is selected and before the rest of the marketing mix is designed. One well-known example is Ivory Soap. This product was created by accident. Air was allowed to work its way into the white soap mixture that was being cooked. The result was Ivory Soap, a new and extraordinarily successful product for Procter &amp; Gamble.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_017">“History of Ivory Soap,” <em class="emphasis">Essortment.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.essortment.com/history-ivory-soap-21051.html">www.essortment.com/history-ivory-soap-21051.html</a>.</span> Most companies do not have this kind of luck, though, so a more deliberate approach to understanding the customer is critical to designing the right marketing mix.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumer</a><span class="glossdef">The person or the company that uses or consumes a product.</span></span> is the person or the company that uses or consumes a product. For example, the customer of a dry cleaning service is the person who drops off clothes, picks them up, and pays for the service. The consumer is the person who wears the clothes. Another example is a food service that caters business events. The person who orders lunch on behalf of the company is the customer. The people who eat the lunch are the consumers. The person who selects the catering service could be either or both. It is common for the customer and the consumer to be the same person, but this should not be assumed for all instances. The challenge is deciding whether to market to the customer or the consumer—or perhaps both.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">There are two major types of customer markets: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business-to-business (B2B)</a><span class="glossdef">Organizations such as corporations; small businesses; government agencies; wholesalers; retailers; and nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals, universities, and museums.</span></span> customers and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">individual consumers or end users (business-to-consumer [B2C])</a><span class="glossdef">People who buy for themselves, their households, friends, coworkers, or for other non-business-related purposes.</span></span>. B2B customers are organizations such as corporations; small businesses; government agencies; wholesalers; retailers; and nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals, universities, and museums. In terms of dollar volume, the B2B market is where the action is. More dollars and products change hands in sales to business buyers than to individual consumers or end users.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_018">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 182.</span> The B2B market offers many opportunities for the small business. Examples of B2B products include office supplies and furniture, machinery, ingredients for food preparation, telephone and cell phone service, and delivery services such as FedEx or UPS.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">The B2C market consists of people who buy for themselves, their households, friends, coworkers, or other non-business-related purposes. Examples of B2C products include cars, houses, clothing, food, telephone and cell phone service, cable television service, and medical services. Opportunities in this market are plentiful for small businesses. A walk down Main Street and a visit to the Internet are testaments to this fact.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Understanding the Customer</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p01">The better a small business understands its customers, the better off it will be. It is not easy, and it takes time, but knowing who the customers are, where they come from, what they like and dislike, and what makes them tick will be of immeasurable value in designing a successful marketing mix. Being intuitive can and does work…but not for everyone and not all the time. A more systematic and thorough approach to understanding the customer makes much more sense. The problem is that many if not most small businesses probably do not take the time to do what it takes to understand their customers. This is an important part of the reason why so many small businesses fail.</p>

Jobs was famous for saying that he did not pay too much attention to customer research, particularly with respect to what customers say they want. Instead, he was very “adept at seeing under the surface of what customers want now; they just don’t realize it until they see it. This ability is best expressed by the German word ‘zeitgeist’—the emerging spirit of the age or mood of the moment. It probably best translates as market readiness or customer readiness.

However, this does not mean that all small businesses take a methodical approach to studying the marketplace and their prospective as well as current consumers. Marketing research among small businesses ranges along a continuum from no research at all to the hiring of a professional research firm. Along the way, there will be both formal and informal approaches, the differences again being attributable to the size, industry, and nature of the business along with the personal predispositions of the small-business owners or managers. Nonetheless, it is important for small-business owners and managers to understand what marketing research is all about and how it can be helpful to their businesses. It is also important to understand that marketing research must take the cultures of different communities into consideration because the target market might not be the same—even in relatively close localities.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Why Do It?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p01">The simple truth is that a small business cannot sell products or services—at least not for long—if customers do not want to buy them. Consider the following true scenario:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_056">Susan Ward, “Do-It-Yourself Market Research—Part 1: You Need Market Research,” <em class="emphasis">About.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/marketing/a/marketresearch.htm">sbinfocanada.about.com/cs/marketing/a/marketresearch.htm</a>.</span> A local small business that specialized in underground sprinkling systems and hot tubs for years decided to start selling go-carts. Not long after they introduced them, they had a fleet of go-carts lined up outside their business with a huge “Must go; prices slashed” banner over them. This was not a surprise to anyone else. Go-carts had nothing to do with their usual products, so why would their regular customers be interested in them? Also, a quick look at the demographics of the area would have revealed that the majority of the consumers in the retirement town were elderly. There would likely be little interest in go-carts. It is clear that the business owner would have benefitted from some marketing research.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p02">Marketing research for small business offers many benefits. For example, companies can find hidden niches, design customer experiences, build customer loyalty, identify new business opportunities, design promotional materials, select channels of distribution, find out which customers are profitable and which are not, determine what areas of the company’s website are generating the most revenue, and identify market trends that are likely to have the greatest impact on the business.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s02_p03">In many ways, small businesses have a marketing research advantage over large businesses. The small business is close to its customers and is able to learn much more quickly about their buying habits, what they like, and what they do not like.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p01">Small businesses can conduct primary or secondary marketing research or a combination of the two. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Primary marketing research</a><span class="glossdef">The collection of data for a specific purpose or project.</span></span> involves the collection of data for a specific purpose or project.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_060">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 91.</span> For example, asking existing customers why they purchase from the business and how they heard about it would be considered primary research. Another example would be conducting a study of specific competitors with respect to products and services offered and their price levels. These would be simple marketing research projects for a small business, either business-to-consumer (B2C) or business-to-business (B2B), and would not require the services of a professional research company. Such companies would be able to provide more sophisticated marketing research, but the cost might be too high for the many small businesses that are operating on a shoestring budget.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p02">Data gathering techniques in primary marketing research can include observation, surveys, interviews, questionnaires, and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">focus groups</a><span class="glossdef">Six to ten people carefully selected by the researcher(s) and brought together to discuss various aspects of interest at length.</span></span>.

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s03_p05">Most small-business owners do marketing research every day—without being aware of it. They analyze returned items, ask former customers why they switched to another company, and look at a competitor’s prices. Formal marketing research simply makes this familiar process orderly by providing the appropriate framework.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_064">“Market Research Basics,” <em class="emphasis">SmallBusiness.com</em>, October 26, 2009, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.com/wiki/Market_research_basics">smallbusiness.com/wiki/Market_research_basics</a>.</span> Effective marketing research follows the following six steps:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_065">Adapted from Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 91–103.</span></p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Define the problem and the research objectives.</strong> Care must be taken not to define the problem too broadly or too narrowly—and not to identify a symptom as the problem. The research objectives should flow from the problem definition.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Develop the research plan.</strong> This is a plan for gathering the needed information, part of which will include cost. Also to be determined is the following: whether primary research, secondary research, or some combination of the two will be used. The specific techniques will be identified, and a timetable will be established.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Collect the information.</strong> This phase is typically the most expensive and the most error prone.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Analyze the information.</strong> Analysis involves extracting meaning from the raw data. It can involve simple tabulations or very sophisticated statistical techniques. The objective is to convert the raw data into actionable information.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Present the findings.</strong> The findings are presented to the decision maker(s). In many small businesses, the owner or the manager may conduct the research, so the findings are presented in a format that will make sense for the owner and other members of the decision-making team.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Make the decision.</strong> The owner or manager must consider the information and decide how to act on it. One possible result is that the information gathered is not sufficient for making a decision. The problem may be a flawed marketing research process or problems obtaining access to appropriate data. The question becomes whether the situation is important enough to warrant additional research.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Does It Cost?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s04_p01">A popular approach with small-business owners is to allocate a small percentage of gross sales for the most recent year for marketing research. This usually amounts to about 2 percent for an existing business. It has been suggested, however, that as much as 10 percent of gross sales should be allocated to marketing research if the business is planning to launch a new product.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_066">“Market Research Basics,” <em class="emphasis">SmallBusiness.com</em>, October 26, 2009, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.com/wiki/Market_research_basics">smallbusiness.com/wiki/Market_research_basics</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s04_p02">There are several things that small businesses can do to keep the costs down. They can do the research on their own; work with local colleges and universities to engage business students in research projects; conduct online surveys using companies such as <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.surveymonkey.com/">SurveyMonkey</a> and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.zoomerang.com">Zoomerang</a>; and create an online community with forums, blogs, and chat sessions that reveal customers’ experiences with a company’s product or the perception of a company’s brand.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_067">John Tozzi, “Market Research on the Cheap,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, January 9, 2008, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/content/jan2008/sb2008019_352779.htm">www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/content/jan2008/sb2008019_352779.htm</a>.</span> The latter two options, of course, presume the existence of an e-commerce operation. Even given the inexpensive options that are available, however, hiring a professional research firm can be worth the price. The specific marketing research choice(s) made will depend, as always, on the size and the nature of the business, the industry, and the individual B2C or B2B small-business owner or manager.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s05_p01">There is no precise answer to this question. As a general rule, marketing research should be done when important marketing decisions must be made. It should be done at times when customers may be easily accessible (e.g., a gift shop may want to conduct research before the holiday season when customers are more likely to be thinking about buying gifts for friends and loved ones), when you are thinking about adding a new product or service to the business, or when a competitor seems to be taking away market share. The trick, though, “is not to wait very long, because your competitors can start getting the answers before you do.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_068">Joy Levin, “How Marketing Research Can Benefit a Small Business,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, January 26, 2006, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2006/01/how-marketing-research-can-benefit-a-small-business.html">smallbiztrends.com/2006/01/how-marketing-research-can-benefit-a-small-business.html</a>.</span></p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Thinking the research will cost too much.</strong> Small businesses definitely face a challenge to afford the costs of marketing research. However, marketing research costs range from free to several thousands of dollars.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Using only secondary research.</strong> The published work of others is a great place to start, but it is often outdated and provides only broad knowledge. More specific knowledge can be obtained from purchasing proprietary reports, but this can be pricey, and the focus may not be quite right. Primary research should also be considered.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Using only web resources.</strong> Data available on the Internet are available to everyone who can find it. It may not be fully accurate, and its accuracy may be difficult to evaluate. Deeper searches can be conducted at the local library, college campus, or small business center.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Surveying only the people you know.</strong> This will not get you the most useful, accurate, and objective information. You must talk to actual customers to find out about their needs, wants, and expectations.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Hitting a wall.</strong> Any research project has its ups and downs. It is easy to lose motivation and shorten the project. Persistence must be maintained because it will all come together in the end. It is important to talk to actual or potential customers early.</li>

Frank had finished reading his son’s business plan for a third time. Robert sensed that his father had some sort of reservations. “What’s the matter, Dad? Didn’t you like the plan?” Frank paused and said, “Bobby, from a technical standpoint I think you have done a very, very credible job, but you are right. I do have some concerns.” Disappointed, Robert asked his father to lay out his concerns.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s03_s06_p03">Frank told him that opening another restaurant was a huge and expensive undertaking. He knew that Robert understood the financial risks, but he was not sure that his son understood the problems associated with getting people to come to a new restaurant. Frank was straightforward and told his son, “I have been at this for thirty-plus years. It took me years to build up my client base. I really know my customers and what they like. Up until this year the only marketing I did was flyers and a few ads in the local paper and the church bulletin. How are we going to understand our customers at the new location? We are going to have to fill it up quickly if we are to pay the bills. I know I’ve had some good success with selling the sauces during the last few years, but remember that I’m selling them from Harry’s grocery store. His customers already know me and my product. Your plans for ramping up sauce sales are great, but again, how are we going to get people to know who we are and interested enough to by a six dollar bottle of barbecue sauce?” Frank went on to tell his son that he knew that Robert was extremely knowledgeable about marketing and the use of the Internet. He reminded Robert that he had given him a greatly enlarged marketing budget in 2010.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p02">The creation of customer value begins with a company commitment to the customer. Marketing has the responsibility for researching the current or prospective customer base, selecting a target market, and then developing a marketing mix that will hopefully meet the value expectations of customers. Product comes first, followed by price, promotion, and place. Delivering customer value should be the key consideration in all marketing mix decisions, with all four Ps working together. A small business needs to be aware, however, that customer value can and does change. What is considered as providing appropriate value one day may change the next day. It is marketing’s responsibility to keep on top of such value migrations so that the marketing mix can be changed accordingly. Fortunately, small businesses are in a stronger position to make marketing mix changes because they are generally more nimble and are closer to the customer.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash-Flow Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p01">Because sales are the only generator of revenue in most small businesses, marketing decisions play a major role in the health of a company’s cash flow. A product or a service that does not sell will have a negative impact on cash flow, whereas a winner can result in a cash-flow bonanza. However, a product or a service that generates major cash can actually send the business into failure if the appropriate cash-flow mechanisms are not in place. The timely collection of money owed and being able to pay for the products and the services needed to run the business are critical to a positive cash flow. Providing extended terms for vendor accounts to be paid, delayed payments from credit cards used by customers for their purchases (something that is expected by most customers as part of the value they receive), the costs associated with an over ambitious expansion, money-losing customer promotions, a product or a service that is priced too low (unable to cover costs), and a distribution approach that does not work well will all have a negative impact on cash flow.</p>
