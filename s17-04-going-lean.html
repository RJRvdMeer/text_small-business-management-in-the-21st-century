This concept was first introduced to American businesspeople in the book <em class="emphasis">The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production—Toyota’s Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now Revolutionizing World Industry</em>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_059">James P. Womack, Daniel T. Jones, and Daniel Roos, <em class="emphasis">The Machine That Changed the World: The Story of Lean Production—Toyota’s Secret Weapon in the Global Car Wars That Is Now Revolutionizing World Industry</em> (New York, Harper Perennial, 1990).</span> This book focused on the global automobile industry. It highlighted the significant differences in productivity between Japanese firms, Toyota in particular, and their American and European rivals. At the time the book was written, Toyota was half the size of General Motors; today, on a global basis, Toyota is larger than General Motors. The book highlighted the approach adopted by Toyota, which is, as articulated by Taiichi Ohno, its developer, centered on “the absolute elimination of waste.”</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p04">Although lean is most closely associated with Toyota, its central principles are applicable for any small and midsize enterprise. Audubon Media Corporation is a publisher of cookbooks. It adopted a program that included a variety of lean techniques. In a two-year period, it increased sales by 25 percent without increasing staffing, reduced lead time by at least 50 percent, and increased available floor space by 20 percent through inventory reduction and more efficient redesign. Corporate Image, a manufacturer of packaging, adopted lean methods and reduced lead times by over 35 percent and reduced costs by nearly $180,000 in one year.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_060">Jim Black, “Kaizen (Continuous Improvement) for Small- and Medium-Sized Companies,” <em class="emphasis">CIRAS News</em> 33, no. 2 (1999), accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ciras.iastate.edu/publications/management/Kaizen.asp">www.ciras.iastate.edu/publications/management/Kaizen.asp</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p05">Lean thinking is predicated on five major principles.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_061">“The Five Principles of Lean Thinking,” <em class="emphasis">Cardiff University</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cardiff.ac.uk/lean/principles/index.html">www.cardiff.ac.uk/lean/principles/index.html</a>.</span> The first principle can be summarized as follows: <em class="emphasis">know who your customers are and know how they define value</em>. This principle coincides nicely with the underlying philosophy of the quality movement, namely, placing the customer first. Without understanding what the customer wants and what the customer values, an organization runs the risk of producing a wasteful quantity of goods and services that the customer does not want or need.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p06">The second principle of lean thinking centers on <em class="emphasis">determining and visualizing the value stream</em>. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">value stream</a><span class="glossdef">The entire set of activities associated with the production of goods and services.</span></span> is the entire set of activities associated with the production of goods and services. The goal of such mapping is to identify any and all activities that provide no value to the customer. Once those nonvalue activities have been identified, they are to be eliminated. Students are required, every semester, to go to their advisor and begin the process to register for the next semester or prepare for graduation. Imagine mapping out every step in that process. Having done that, colleges and universities could probably find some steps or activities that do not add value. In a lean operation, those steps would be eliminated. One could also think in terms of the process that most patients face when going to some type of medical facility. They are often required to fill out multiple forms that require the same information. In <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_f01">Figure 13.5 "Value Stream Map for Supplying Hospitals with Blood"</a>, we provide an example of a value stream map for the process of supplying hospitals with blood.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p07">The third principle of lean thinking argues that every effort should be made to <em class="emphasis">make the remaining steps flow</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">flow</em> here refers to the notion that from design to delivery to the customer, all steps and activities should be structured in such a way that there will be minimal or nonexistent downtime, waste, or waiting within or between the steps.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_062">“The Principles of Lean Thinking: Tools and Techniques for Advanced Manufacturing,” <em class="emphasis">Industial Technology Centre</em>, accessed February 4, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.itc.mb.ca/downloads/resources_by_topic/princ_lean%20thinking/PrinciplesofLeanThinkingRevD2004.pdf">www.itc.mb.ca/downloads/resources_by_topic/princ_lean%20thinking/PrinciplesofLeanThinkingRevD2004.pdf</a>.</span> This is perhaps the most challenging of all the five principles of lean thinking. To make operations flow in a seamless manner often requires substantive changes in production and service processes. In fact, it may require substantive changes to the structure of a business.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p08">The fourth principle involves a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">pull system</a><span class="glossdef">The production of the goods and services are triggered by customer demand.</span></span> <em class="emphasis">triggered by customer needs</em>. The term <em class="emphasis">pull</em> means that the production of goods and services is triggered by customer demand. This aspect of lean is what is commonly referred to as just-in-time inventory. The central idea is that the entire value stream is fired up only by customer demand. Thus inventory throughout the system is minimized.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p09">The fifth and last principle is <em class="emphasis">pursuing perfection</em>. This clearly shows that lean thinking is not totally separate and divorced from the concepts of total quality management or Six Sigma. This last principle advocates that removing the impediments to quality will mean a significant reduction in waste. Like Crosby’s work, lean advocates often talk of striving for zero defects.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p10">One of the first steps in any lean program is identifying where waste exists within the system. Taiichi Ohno and Shigeo Shingo, the two cofounders of the Toyota Production System, identified seven possible sources of waste: <strong class="emphasis bold">transportation</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">inventory</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">motion</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">waiting</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">overprocessing</strong>, <strong class="emphasis bold">overproduction</strong>, and <strong class="emphasis bold">defects</strong>. (A nice mnemonic to remember these seven sources is TIM WOOD.) <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_t01">Table 13.4 "Seven Sources of Manufacturing Wastes"</a> identifies and gives examples of the original seven sources of waste used throughout Toyota.</p>

Simplicity accomplishes the task, minimizes the chance for failure, and reduces waste. A classic example of this would be the engineers who were asked to determine the volume of a complex part. Some began by taking accurate measurements to compute the volume of some segments of the part. Another engineer simply tossed the part into a bucket of water and measured the volume of water displaced.</td>

Some businesses have set up operations where they believe that production in large batches is the most economically efficient method. This generally means large inventory levels. Overproduction is seen by some as the driving force behind the other six sources of waste. Lean thinking tasks them to reexamine these basic assumptions.</td>
                    <td>A manufacturer has a good idea of the annual demand of a particular part. Setting up the machine that is used to produce this part is an expense proposition. Financial analysis indicates that the company should produce one batch of the part every quarter (three months’ worth of supply). A three-month supply of the part means that a considerable portion sits in inventory for a long period of time. This quantity of inventory may also mask any defects in manufacturing. It would take quite a while to go through this batch before one would realize that the batch might have had problems in production. A company that focused on reducing the setup cost of the machine could then produce smaller batches, which, in turn, would produce lower inventory levels and therefore catch quality problems earlier.</td>

One technique that has broad application in both manufacturing and service environments is known as the 5 Ss. The five Ss refer to Japanese terms for, in effect, housekeeping.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_065">“5S Check List,” <em class="emphasis">Systems2win</em>, accessed March 9, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.systems2win.com/solutions/5S.htm">www.systems2win.com/solutions/5S.htm</a>.</span> The five <em class="emphasis">S</em>s, which together strive for simplicity and neatness to improve efficiency and effectiveness, are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_l02">
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Seiei or organization.</strong> Only those tools and equipment that are absolutely needed are available at any one time. All other equipment is stored away until needed.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Seiton or orderliness.</strong> Every part is in its correct place. The Japanese use pegboards to store tools. They sometime draw an outline of the tool on the board so that it is returned to its correct place.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Seiso or cleanliness.</strong> Work environments are kept immaculate. This is done to reinforce the notion of perfect. Some factory floors are painted white so that anything dropped or any litter becomes immediately apparent.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Seitetsu or standardized cleanup.</strong> This is a reinforcement of the prior three points. Starting in Japanese kindergartens, children are required to clean their classroom—together—before they are released to go home.</li>
        <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Shitsuke or discipline.</strong> A program to adhere to set procedures because of pride in one’s own work.</li>
    </ul>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch13_s04_p12">More and more businesses are realizing that lean thinking and quality are not two distinct management approaches but two extremely complementary models. One finds more and more references to a concept known as Lean Six Sigma, which is a program that combines aspects of both lean thinking and quality management. It recognizes that lean by itself cannot bring processes under control, and Six Sigma significantly reduces process time or capital investment.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn13_066">Michael George, <em class="emphasis">Lean Six Sigma for Service: How to Use Lean Speed and Six Sigma Quality to Improve Services and Transactions</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill, 2003), 6.</span> Both approaches offer benefits to small businesses that cannot be ignored if these businesses want to remain viable in an increasingly competitive world.</p>
