        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Value Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p01">It is the customer who decides whether to buy a small business’s products or services. The customer decides whether the appropriate value is present, and that value will always be as he or she perceives it. “The decision to buy and the price that customers are willing to pay is dependent on their assessment of the value they will receive from one product relative to the known alternatives.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_070">Robert R. Harmon and Greg Laird, “Linking Marketing Strategy to Customer Value: Implications for Technology Marketers,” <em class="emphasis">IEEEXplore Digital Library</em>, July 31, 1997, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=653700">ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=653700</a>.</span> Marketing plays a key role in creating and delivering value to the customer, but it is the establishment of a strong link between customer value requirements and the major value-producing activities of the firm that is the foundation on which the delivery of superior customer value is based.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_071">Robert R. Harmon and Greg Laird, “Linking Marketing Strategy to Customer Value: Implications for Technology Marketers,” <em class="emphasis">IEEEXplore Digital Library</em>, July 31, 1997, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=653700">ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/freeabs_all.jsp?arnumber=653700</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s01_p02">The creation of customer value begins with a company commitment to the customer. Marketing has the responsibility for researching the current or prospective customer base, selecting a target market, and then developing a marketing mix that will hopefully meet the value expectations of customers. Product comes first, followed by price, promotion, and place. Delivering customer value should be the key consideration in all marketing mix decisions, with all four Ps working together. A small business needs to be aware, however, that customer value can and does change. What is considered as providing appropriate value one day may change the next day. It is marketing’s responsibility to keep on top of such value migrations so that the marketing mix can be changed accordingly. Fortunately, small businesses are in a stronger position to make marketing mix changes because they are generally more nimble and are closer to the customer.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash-Flow Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s02_p01">Because sales are the only generator of revenue in most small businesses, marketing decisions play a major role in the health of a company’s cash flow. A product or a service that does not sell will have a negative impact on cash flow, whereas a winner can result in a cash-flow bonanza. However, a product or a service that generates major cash can actually send the business into failure if the appropriate cash-flow mechanisms are not in place. The timely collection of money owed and being able to pay for the products and the services needed to run the business are critical to a positive cash flow. Providing extended terms for vendor accounts to be paid, delayed payments from credit cards used by customers for their purchases (something that is expected by most customers as part of the value they receive), the costs associated with an over ambitious expansion, money-losing customer promotions, a product or a service that is priced too low (unable to cover costs), and a distribution approach that does not work well will all have a negative impact on cash flow.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p01">The integration, acceptance, and popularity of technology in the current marketplace and workplace are widespread, particularly with respect to marketing. Marketing opportunities have exploded with the rise of digital technology and the Internet, and with those opportunities have come new ways to make marketing decisions and interact with customers.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s04_s03_p02">As do all businesses, small businesses should be concerned about the customer experience. Emerging mobile technologies make it possible “to elevate the classic brick-and-mortar shopper experience.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_072">Nathan Pettyjohn, “Evolving the Customer Experience with Mobile Technology,” <em class="emphasis">MarketingProfs</em>, December 28, 2010, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2010/4134/evolving-the-customer-experience-with-mobile-technology">www.marketingprofs.com/articles/2010/4134/evolving-the-customer-experience -with-mobile-technology</a>.</span> But there is a cautionary note.

Nonetheless, it is a technology that small retail businesses should keep their eye on. One retail shopping solution is being developed by ARS Interactive and CellPoint Mobile. It will be “the only fully integrated mobile retail shopping solution in the United States that combines product information, coupons, customer loyalty and mobile payment into one experience. This will give customers complete shopping control directly from their mobile phones, while providing retailers with a constant customer touch-point inside and outside the store.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_073">“Mobile Retail Shopping Solution Featuring Near Field Communication Technology,” <em class="emphasis">PRWeb</em>, January 6, 2011, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.prweb.com/releases/2011/ARSMOBILE/prweb4946004.htm">www.prweb.com/releases/2011/ARSMOBILE/prweb4946004.htm</a>.</span></p>
