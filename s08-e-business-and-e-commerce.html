        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_p01">In 1980, John Sortino got the idea for making teddy bears. He was playing with his young son, Graham, and noticed that none of Graham’s 38 stuffed animals was made in the United States. This inspired John to make a teddy bear for Graham—named Bearcho. John then went on to make others, falling in love with the idea of making them by hand. Bearcho was soon followed by Buffy, Bearazar, and Fuzzy Wuzzy, all made in his wife’s sewing room. By 1983, John was selling his bears from a gift cart at an open-air market in Burlington, Vermont. The sale of his first bear took 4 days, and it took 1 year to sell 200 bears.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_001">“The Vermont Teddy Bear Story,” <em class="emphasis">Vermont Teddy Bear Company</em>, accessed March 24, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.vermontteddybear.com/Static/Our-Story.aspx">www.vermontteddybear.com/Static/Our-Story.aspx</a>; “Vermont Teddy Bear Company,” <em class="emphasis">Score.org</em>, accessed March 24, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.score.org/success-stories/vermont-teddy-bear-company">www.score.org/success-stories/vermont-teddy-bear-company</a>.</span> Today, the Vermont Teddy Bear Company produces about 300,000 bears a year.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_p02">The Vermont Teddy Bear Company has tapped into America’s long-standing love affair with teddy bears by creating a wide variety of customized teddy bears and shipping them to customers via the well-recognized Bear-Gram, “…a customized bear placed in a colorful box with an air hole and game printed on the inside, and enclosed with a personalized greeting and candy treat.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_002">“The Vermont Teddy Bear Story,” <em class="emphasis">Vermont Teddy Bear Company</em>, accessed March 24, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.vermontteddybear.com/Static/Our-Story.aspx">www.vermontteddybear.com/Static/Our-Story.aspx</a>.</span> The company has experienced many changes, including John’s departure in 1995 to pursue other interests and the addition of Pajamagram and Calyx Flowers as additional unique brands, but the Vermont Teddy Bear Company remains a household name and a Vermont icon.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_p03">Jay Bruns, vice president of branding, talks about the importance of knowing how to present the product so the company can grow further. Right now, a Vermont Teddy Bear is a unique gift item that promises quality for life, but the dynamics of gifting have changed. Same day or overnight delivery is not special anymore, so a Vermont Teddy Bear must offer something more than convenience. It needs to be a “go-to” gift of choice rather than an emergency or “last-minute” gift. This requires presenting the product as fresh and special.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_003">Telephone interview with Jay Bruns, vice president of branding, Vermont Teddy Bear Company, March 9, 2012.</span> E-commerce is an integral part of Vermont Teddy Bear’s marketing strategy, with online sales accounting for more than one-half of its total sales. The company saw the growth in online buying and launched its website in October 1996 in an effort to reach the online consumer base. Elisabeth Robert, the CEO at the time, saw the potential synergy between radio and the Internet and used the power of the company’s radio advertising “…to direct customers to the company’s website where they could actually see the bears they were ordering.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_004">Portland Helmich, “Not Your Average Bear,” <em class="emphasis">Business People Vermont</em>, 2002, accessed March 24, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.vermontguides.com/2002/2-feb/teddybear.htm">www.vermontguides.com/2002/2-feb/teddybear.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_p04">Victor Castro, director of e-commerce, describes the company’s e-commerce strategy as direct marketing with a focus on easy ordering and the customer being able to interact with the brand. Convenience has become even more convenient, and the Vermont Teddy Bear Company makes things simple. As the consumer becomes more proficient online, it will be necessary to communicate properly what the Vermont Teddy Bear gift is all about (i.e., the experience of owning the bear). Castro says that the company has been very successful at that. However, the company’s e-commerce strategy must evolve with changes in the online customer.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_005">Telephone interview with Victor Castro, director of e-commerce, Vermont Teddy Bear Company, March 9, 2012.</span></p>

Therefore, a small business can choose to incorporate all, some, or none of the e-business components.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">The decision to engage in e-commerce is an important one. The advantages are clear: lower business costs; 24/7 accessibility anywhere; the potential for stronger customer service; the ability to introduce a niche product; the ability to reach global markets on a more equalized basis with larger firms, making mass customization possible; and greater customer loyalty. But the risks are there as well. Internet problems, website problems, security and privacy breaches, intellectual property theft, legal liability, product and/or service failure, customer deceit, and customer dissatisfaction are but a few of the risks. Therefore, the choice of an e-commerce business model must be made carefully. Each model will have different implications in terms of business planning and strategy.</p>

                <li>E-business consists of several major components, one of which is e-commerce.</li>
                <li>Every Internet business is either pure-play (an Internet presence only) or brick-and-click (having both a physical and an online presence).</li>

                <li>An e-commerce business model is the method that a business uses to generate revenue online. Some models are very simple; others are more complicated. New business models are being introduced all the time.</li>

            <li>If using a contract with another party, make sure the contract says that any dispute must be filed in your home state and that both parties to the contract agree to jurisdiction in that state.</li>
            <li>When a customer is purchasing an item on the website of a business, one of the terms and conditions of the transaction should be that the customer agree to jurisdiction in the home state of that business. This can be done with a check box next to the statement. Make the customer check it off before completing the purchase.</li>
            <li>A less effective way is to include a disclaimer on the website that any transaction will convey jurisdiction to the home state of a business, and any dispute must be heard by a court of competent jurisdiction in the home state of the business.</li>

However, the laws in other countries will undoubtedly introduce complications into protecting the US-based business. Take the example of Yahoo! and the sale of Nazi memorabilia on one of its auction websites. A French court ruled that such sales breached French law against the display of Nazi items. Yahoo! took steps to remove and ban all such hate paraphernalia from its auction sites, but it continued to fight jurisdiction of the French ruling in American courts.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_064">Kathleen Mykytn and Peter Mykytn, “The Importance of the Law For E-Commerce Strategies,” <em class="emphasis">Information Systems Management</em> 22, no. 2 (2005): 50–56.</span> It would be very easy for a small business to inadvertently find itself in a similar situation. That is why a business needs to be careful when selling outside its home country. Be familiar with foreign laws. This is not an easy task because the minute a business website goes live, the business goes global. The laws of the world suddenly become relevant.</p>

The implication is that e-commerce operations should focus more specifically and explicitly on the ethics messages that are being conveyed by the website. Thus the focus of this ethics discussion is on three major components of e-commerce ethics: security, privacy, and trust.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p10">Fortunately, the theft of credit card and other personal information originating from websites accounted for only about 11 percent of the identity theft or fraud that affected 11 million Americans in 2009.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_081">“Javelin Study Finds Identity Fraud Reached New High in 2008, but Consumers Are Fighting Back,” <em class="emphasis">Javelin Strategy and Research</em>, February 10, 2010, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.javelinstrategy.com/news/831/92/Javelin-Study-Finds-Identity-Fraud-Reached-New-High-but-Consumers-are-Fighting-Back/d,pressRoomDetail">www.javelinstrategy.com/news/831/92/Javelin-Study-Finds-Identity-Fraud -Reached-New-High-but-Consumers-are-Fighting-Back/d,pressRoomDetail</a>.</span> This is why the act of providing credit card information on a website for a purchase is still considered by some people to be so risky that they refuse to conduct any Internet transactions.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s04_p11">Fortunately, there is a very straightforward way to provide the security and privacy that online customers seek: the use of <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Secure Sockets Layer (SSL)</a><span class="glossdef">A security protocol that is used by web browsers and web servers to help users protect their data during transfer.</span></span>, a security protocol that is used by web browsers and web servers to help users protect their data during transfer.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_082">“FAQ: SSL Basics,” <em class="emphasis">VeriSign Authentication Services</em>, 2011, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/ssl-basics">www.verisign.com/ssl/ssl-information-center/ssl-basics</a>.</span>
Companies like <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.verisign.com">VeriSign</a> offer SSL protection certificates, and the placement of its icon on a website can offer security and privacy assurances to online customers.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Trust</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p01">Trust is about believing—believing that someone will do what they say and that they will not intentionally do something to hurt you. Trust is an important part of all business relationships. Without trust, all e-commerce would come to a halt. “Trust is central to establishing successful e-commerce ventures and to ensure the continued success of this business paradigm into the future.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_083">Albert J. Marcella, <em class="emphasis">Establishing Trust in Virtual Markets</em> (Altamonte Springs, FL: The Institute of Internal Auditors, 1999), as cited in Beverly Kracher and Corritore, “Is There A Special E-Commerce Ethics?,” <em class="emphasis">Business Ethics Quarterly</em> 14, no. 1 (2004): 71–94.</span> Trust will improve competitiveness, reduce the costs of doing business, build loyalty, and increase the effectiveness of websites. In short, trust can be an important source of competitive advantage. Trust is essential.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p02">In the physical world, trust is much easier to develop. Physical cues from spaces and buildings, face-to-face voice and body language, and salesperson effectiveness can translate easily into trust relationships. In the online world, however, trust develops as a result of the complex interaction of multiple factors that have design implications for the website. Here are some examples of trust:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_084">Avshalom Adam, Avshalom Aderet, and Arik Sadeh, “Do Ethics Matter to E-Consumers?,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Internet Commerce</em> 6, no. 2 (2007): 19–34; Andrea Everard and Dennis F.

        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_l01">
            <li>The customer observes the seller to be honest, fair, responsible, and benevolent.</li>
            <li>The customer expects that the company behind the website will not engage in opportunistic behavior.</li>
            <li>The customer is confident about the site’s security and privacy protection (security and privacy having been shown to be an important determinant of a customer’s willingness to buy online).</li>
            <li>The customer perceives the company’s website as appealing (linked to layout, typography, font size, and color choices)—the belief being that an appealing website reflects a company has the capabilities and resources to fulfill its promises.</li>
            <li>The customer experiences a site that is easy to use (i.e., easy to navigate, easy to search, easy to gather information) and has relevant content, interactivity, site consistency, and site reliability.</li>
            <li>The customer perceives presentation flaws (e.g., poor style, incompleteness, language errors, conflicting colors, delay, and confusing terminology) as indicators of a low-quality, untrustworthy website.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p03">Another element of trust is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">order fulfillment</a><span class="glossdef">Meeting customer expectations with respect to processing the order and delivering of the product.</span></span>. Order fulfillment is all about meeting expectations, and some argue that this is the most important element of trust.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_085">Terry Newholm et al., “Multi-Story Trust and Online Retailer Strategies,” <em class="emphasis">International Review of Retail, Distribution and Consumer Research</em>, 14, no. 4 (2004): 437–56.</span> Delays in the delivery of a product, the delivery of the wrong product, and the hassles of returning merchandise are stresses that can contribute to a less-than-satisfactory Internet buying experience. Such experiences contribute to a lack of trust. In contrast, satisfied consumers express themselves this way:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_086">Sergio Roman, “The Ethics of Online Retailing: A Scale Development and Validation from the Consumers’ Perspective,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Ethics</em> 72 (2007): 131–48.</span></p>

        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p04">Buying some products online, such as clothing, furniture, and toys, does not offer buyers the opportunity to touch and feel the product before buying. As a result, order fulfillment becomes even more important to customer satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s02_s05_p05">Linked closely to order fulfillment is <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">product reliability</a><span class="glossdef">The accurate display and description of a product so that what customers receive is what they thought they ordered.</span></span>. Product reliability refers to “the accurate display and description of a product so that what customers receive is what they thought they ordered.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_087">Sergio Roman, “The Ethics of Online Retailing: A Scale Development and Validation from the Consumers’ Perspective,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Business Ethics</em> 72 (2007): 131–48.</span> Online retailers should provide a complete and realistic description of the product and its benefits—with high-quality pictures and perhaps even demonstration videos if possible, appropriate, and affordable—along with product availability and likely ship dates. Customers should be notified by e-mail of order acceptance, and the anticipated delivery date with phone and e-mail contacts for any needed assistance.</p>

Additional payment methods should be added as quickly as the budget allows because it is clear that more payment options translate into a greater likelihood of purchase. However, the choice of alternative payment methods should be in keeping with the growth strategy of the business. It may be that offering one method of payment provides a satisfactory level of sales, thereby eliminating the need for additional methods for sales growth.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p01">E-business in general and e-commerce in particular can both contribute to increased customer value. In the case of e-business, moving operations to digital technology can improve productivity, reduce or eliminate duplicative processes, streamline supply chain management and enterprise resource planning, improve customer and vendor relationships, improve business intelligence, increase and improve internal collaboration while doing the same with external business partners. In all instances, the customer, the vendor, and the business partner should realize increased value from doing business with the company in terms of greater efficiency, speed of information flows and transactions, and overall satisfaction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s04_s01_p02">In the case of e-commerce, customer value is provided via convenience, a greater selection of products, the ability to easily compare prices and services, 24/7 availability, privacy protection, multiple payment options, and reliable order fulfillment processes. Web 2.0, in particular, presents “consumers with a whole array of options in searching for value products and services and finding exactly what they need and want with minimum efforts, in line with the current customer desire for personalization, individual approach and empowerment.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_116">Efthymios Constantinides and Stefan J.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_p01">Although not all small businesses may choose to go the route of digital technology and the e-environment (e-business and e-commerce), it has been advised on many fronts that small businesses seriously consider creative ways in which to incorporate them all into their operations. Digital technology is difficult to avoid, whether it be computers, <strong class="emphasis bold">smartphones</strong>, or iPads (see the story of Lloyd’s Construction in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch01#cadden_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Foundations for Small Business"</a>). Even on a small scale, digital technology can help improve business processes and keep costs down.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s04_s03_p02">The importance of e-business and e-commerce to small business has been the focus of this chapter. Realistically, neither can be avoided by small businesses that want to grow. E-commerce in particular has opened up the world to small business. Websites have “created a flattening effect in the sense that small businesses and large businesses [are] suddenly on a level playing field…The web [allows] small companies to have the same reach as a large firm. A small company’s web site [can] be viewed a million times just as easily as a large firm’s web site, and that information [is] available worldwide, 24 hours a day. Small businesses [can] now have some of the same abilities as large companies to reach customers with rich content of information about their products nationally or internationally.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn04_120">Sang-Heui Lee, David DeWester, and So Ra Park, “Web 2.0 and Opportunities for Small Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">Service Business</em> 2, no. 4 (2008): 335–45.</span> The small business that wants to grow will ignore e-business and e-commerce at its peril.</p>

McCormick had done her homework. She originally leased the store front for a temporary stint, selling a line of unique handcrafted products and locally made foods while asking people what sort of products they wished were available in the area. In this way, she was able to build the kind of store that was needed, using the existing demand to decide what kinds of products she would offer.</p>

What she did not know was that someone had hacked into her computer system. From somewhere unknown, the hard drive of her computer in the store had been hacked. The hackers had downloaded a key-logging program (a virus that makes it possible for the hacker to record all your keystrokes, gaining access to passwords and other sensitive information). The hackers were able to see everything that she typed into the computer: e-mails, communications with vendors and customers, passwords—everything. The hackers only had to wait until she logged into her online bank account before they had all the information they needed for the payoff. She soon discovered that someone had been in her bank account, transferring money at will. The hackers had changed the password. The system crashed immediately.</p>
