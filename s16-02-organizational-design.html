            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s04_p03">The virtual organization can be quite attractive to small businesses and start-ups. By outsourcing much of the operations of a business, costs and capital requirements will be significantly reduced and flexibility enhanced. Given the lower capital requirements of a virtual business, some measures of profitability (e.g., return on investment [ROI] and return on assets [ROA]), would be significantly increased. This makes a business much more financially attractive to potential investors or banks, which might provide funding for future growth. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ROI</a><span class="glossdef">A performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or compare the efficiency of several investments.</span></span> “is a performance measure used to evaluate the efficiency of an investment or to compare the efficiency of a number of investments.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_101">“Return on Investment—ROI,” <em class="emphasis">Investopedia</em>, accessed February 2, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp">www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnoninvestment.asp</a>.</span> <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">ROA</a><span class="glossdef">An indicator of how profitable a business is relative to its assets and indicates how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings.</span></span> is “an indicator of how profitable a company is relative to its assets…[giving] an idea as to how efficient management is at using its assets to generate earnings.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_102">“Return on Assets—ROA,” <em class="emphasis">Investopedia</em>, accessed February 2, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp">www.investopedia.com/terms/r/returnonassets.asp</a>.</span></p>

                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s04_p04">Thinking and rethinking the business organization structure is important for all businesses—large or small. Conditions, products, and markets change. It is important to be flexible in creating a business structure that will best allow a business to operate effectively and efficiently. Each of the following should be considered:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s04_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Competitors.</strong> Make an educated guess of the structure of competitors. Try to find out what works for them. Look at their reporting line structures and their procurement, production, marketing, and management systems. Perhaps there are some good ideas to be had.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Industry.</strong> Is there a standard in an industry? Perhaps an industry lends itself to flexible organization structures, or perhaps more hierarchical structures are the norm. For example, auto manufacturers are usually set up regionally.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Compliance or legal requirements.</strong> If an industry is regulated, certain elements may be required in the business structure. Even if an industry is not regulated, there may be compliance issues associated with employing a certain number of employees.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Investors and lending sources.</strong> Having a business organization structure will give potential investors and funding institutions a window into how the business organizes its operations. The structure also lets investors and lenders know what kind of talent is needed, how soon they will be needed, and how the business will find and attract them.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_103">“A Strong Business Organization Structure Is Paramount to Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">The Business Plan</em>, accessed February 2, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-business-plan.com/business-organization-structure.html">www.the-business-plan.com/business-organization-structure.html</a>.</span>

                    <li>Organizations are changing every day, so small business owners should be flexible enough to change their structure over time as the situation demands.</li>
                    <li>The functional structure is overwhelmingly the choice of business start-ups and is probably the most commonly used structure today.</li>
                    <li>The functional structure organizes a business according to the job or the purpose in the organization and is most easily recognized by departments that focus on a single function or goal.</li>
                    <li>The divisional structure is a decentralized version of the functional structure. The functions still exist, but they are based on product, geographic area or territory, or customer.</li>
                    <li>As a small business starts to grow, there is an evolution away from the functional to the divisional structure. However, significant growth is required before the divisional structure is put into place.</li>
                    <li>The matrix structure brings specialists from different areas of a business together to work on different projects for a short-term basis. This structure is for project-oriented businesses, such as aerospace, construction, or small manufacturers.</li>
                    <li>In the virtual structure, administration is the primary function performed, with other functions—such as marketing, engineering, production, and finance—outsourced to other companies or individuals. This structure can be quite attractive to small businesses and start-ups.</li>
                    <li>Creating an effective business organization structure should take the competition, the industry, compliance or legal requirements, investors, and lending sources into consideration.</li>

                    <li>Select two small businesses that market two very different products, for example, a small manufacturer and a restaurant. Contact the manager of each business and conduct a fifteen-minute interview about the organizational structure that has been chosen. Ask each manager to describe the existing organizational structure (drawing an organization chart), explain why that structure was chosen, and reflect on the effectiveness and efficiency of the structure. Also ask each manager whether any thoughts have been given to changing the existing structure.</li>
                    <li>Frank Rainsford has been, in effect, the CEO of Frank’s All-American BarBeQue since its inception. His major role has been that of restaurant manager, receiving support from his assistant manager Ed Tobor for the last fourteen years. Frank has two children, a son and daughter, who both worked in the restaurant as teenagers. His daughter has worked periodically at the restaurant since she graduated from high school. Frank’s son, who recently lost his job, has returned to work for his father. The son produced several plans to expand the business, including the opening of a second restaurant and the extensive use of social media. After careful consideration, Frank has decided to open a second restaurant, but this has presented him with a major problem—how to assign responsibilities to personnel. His son wants to be designated the restaurant manager of the second restaurant and made the vice president of marketing. Ed Tobor also wants to be the manager of the new restaurant. His daughter has expressed an interest in being the manager of either restaurant. How should Frank resolve this problem?</li>
