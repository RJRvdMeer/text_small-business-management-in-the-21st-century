        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p01">The idea for <a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=inline">Unnamed Publisher</a>, the publisher of this book, started on a business trip to Chicago in 2006. Co-founders Jeff Shelstad and Eric Frank, who were both working at a large educational publisher at the time, decided they wanted to move away from the limitations and the frustrations of the traditional publishing industry. Veterans of the higher education publishing industry. Their vision was to create a new publishing company that offered a lot more choices to students, professors, and authors.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p02">“Students can’t afford to pay $200 for a textbook. The old business model wasn’t adapting fast enough to the Internet, where so much information was available for free or low-cost,” says Jeff, referring to traditional publishers. “We knew there had to be a better way to publish high-quality material <em class="emphasis">and</em> eliminate price and access barriers.”</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p03">Since its beginning in 2007, more than thirty employees have joined this fast-growing start-up, located just north of New York City, in Irvington, New York. The company has become a recognized pioneer in transforming higher educational publishing and textbook affordability.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p04">FWK is upending the $8 billion college textbook industry with a new business model that focuses on affordability and personalization. Professors who assign FWK books are free to revise and edit the material to match their course and help improve student success. Students have a choice of affordable print and digital formats that they can access online or on a laptop, tablet, e-reader or smartphone for a fraction of the price that most traditional publishers charge.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p05">Rather than hamper the company’s growth, the economic downturn has actually highlighted the value of its products and the viability of its business model. Despite the bad economy, FWK has been able to raise over $30 million in venture capital. Clearly, they are doing something right.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p06">The numbers tell the story. Since the launch of their first ten books in spring 2009 (there are more than one hundred fifteen books to date), faculty at more than two thousand institutions in forty-four countries have adopted FWK books. As a result, more than 600,000 students have benefited from affordable textbook choices that lower costs, increase access and personalize learning.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p07">In 2010, 2011 and 2012, <em class="emphasis">EContent</em> magazine named FWK as one of the top one hundred companies that matter most in the digital content industry. FWK was also named 2010 Best Discount Textbook Provider by the Education Resources People’s Choice Awards.</p>
        <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_p08">What is particularly refreshing is Jeff’s philosophy about people and work. “Give talented people an opportunity to build something meaningful, the tools to do it, and the freedom to do one’s best.” He believes in flexibility with people and their jobs, and, to that end, employees have the option to work remotely. There is no question that FWK is an innovator in the educational publishing industry, but it also knows how to treat people well and provide a challenging environment that fosters personal growth.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_p01">All small businesses need to be concerned about management principles. Management decisions will impact the success of a business, the health of its work environment, its growth if growth is an objective, and customer value and satisfaction. Seat-of-the-pants management may work temporarily, but its folly will inevitably take a toll on a business. This section discusses management principles, levels, and skills—all areas that small business owners should understand so that they can make informed and effective choices for their businesses.</p>
    <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is Management?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p01">There is no universally accepted definition for management. The definitions run the gamut from very simple to very complex. For our purposes, we define <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">management</a><span class="glossdef">The application of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling functions in the most efficient manner possible to accomplish meaningful organizational objectives.</span></span> as “the application of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling functions in the most efficient manner possible to accomplish meaningful organizational objectives.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_001">John M. Ivancevich and Thomas N. Duening, <em class="emphasis">Business: Principles, Guidelines, and Practices</em> (Mason, OH: Atomic Dog Publishing, 2007), 172.</span> Put more simply, management is all about achieving organizational objectives through people and other resources.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_002">David L. Kurtz, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011), 254.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s01_p02">Management principles apply to all organizations—large or small, for-profit or not-for-profit. Even one-person small businesses need to be concerned about management principles because without a fundamental understanding of how businesses are managed, there can be no realistic expectation of success. Remember that the most common reason attributed to small business failure is failure on the part of management.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_p01">On any given day, small business owners and managers will engage in a mix of many different kinds of activities—for example, deal with crises as they arise, read, think, write, talk to people, arrange for things to be done, have meetings, send e-mails, conduct performance evaluations, and plan. Although the amount of time that is spent on each activity will vary, all the activities can be assigned to one or more of the five management functions: planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling (<a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch12_s01_s02_f01">Figure 12.1 "Management Functions"</a>).</p>

Each person in the business should know who is responsible for what, have the authority to carry out his or her responsibilities, and not get conflicting instructions from different bosses.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Post-hoc management.</strong> As judge and jury, management is always right and never to blame. This approach ensures security in the leader’s job.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Micromanagement.</strong> Alive and well in businesses of all sizes, this style assumes that the subordinate is incapable of doing the job, so close instruction is provided, and everything is checked.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Kipper management.</strong> This is the manager who is, like a fish, two-faced because employees can see only one face at a time. To senior managers, this person is typically a model employee who puts business first and himself last. To subordinates, however, the reverse is often the case. The subordinates will work hard to get things done in time, but they are blamed when things go wrong—even if it is not their fault. The kipper will be a friend when things need to get done and then stab the subordinates in the back when glory or reward is to be gained.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_030">“Leadership Styles,” <em class="emphasis">Changing Minds</em>, accessed February 2, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://changingminds.org/disciplines/leadership/styles/leadership_styles.htm">changingminds.org/disciplines/leadership/styles/leadership_styles.htm</a>.</span> We have all seen this kind of manager, perhaps even worked for one.</li>

                <li>Management is about achieving organizational objectives through people.</li>
                <li>The most common reason attributed to small business failure is failure on the part of management.</li>
                <li>On any given day, a typical small business owner or manager will be engaged in some mix of planning, organizing, staffing, directing, and controlling.</li>
                <li>Different situations call for different leadership styles. The three major styles are autocratic, democratic, and laissez-faire. Bad leaders typically stick with one style.</li>
                <li>The management hierarchy is typically composed of three levels: top or executive, middle, and first-line or supervisory. If a small business is large enough to have these three levels, it is important that there be a clear distinction between them.</li>

Staff personnel can be extremely helpful in improving the effectiveness of line personnel. Unfortunately, staff personnel are often the first to go when cutbacks occur.

                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s04_p04">Thinking and rethinking the business organization structure is important for all businesses—large or small. Conditions, products, and markets change. It is important to be flexible in creating a business structure that will best allow a business to operate effectively and efficiently. Each of the following should be considered:</p>
                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s04_l01">
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Competitors.</strong> Make an educated guess of the structure of competitors. Try to find out what works for them. Look at their reporting line structures and their procurement, production, marketing, and management systems. Perhaps there are some good ideas to be had.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Industry.</strong> Is there a standard in an industry? Perhaps an industry lends itself to flexible organization structures, or perhaps more hierarchical structures are the norm. For example, auto manufacturers are usually set up regionally.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Compliance or legal requirements.</strong> If an industry is regulated, certain elements may be required in the business structure. Even if an industry is not regulated, there may be compliance issues associated with employing a certain number of employees.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Investors and lending sources.</strong> Having a business organization structure will give potential investors and funding institutions a window into how the business organizes its operations. The structure also lets investors and lenders know what kind of talent is needed, how soon they will be needed, and how the business will find and attract them.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_103">“A Strong Business Organization Structure Is Paramount to Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">The Business Plan</em>, accessed February 2, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.the-business-plan.com/business-organization-structure.html">www.the-business-plan.com/business-organization-structure.html</a>.</span>

                <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s02_s03_s04_l02">
                    <li>Organizations are changing every day, so small business owners should be flexible enough to change their structure over time as the situation demands.</li>
                    <li>The functional structure is overwhelmingly the choice of business start-ups and is probably the most commonly used structure today.</li>
                    <li>The functional structure organizes a business according to the job or the purpose in the organization and is most easily recognized by departments that focus on a single function or goal.</li>
                    <li>The divisional structure is a decentralized version of the functional structure. The functions still exist, but they are based on product, geographic area or territory, or customer.</li>
                    <li>As a small business starts to grow, there is an evolution away from the functional to the divisional structure. However, significant growth is required before the divisional structure is put into place.</li>
                    <li>The matrix structure brings specialists from different areas of a business together to work on different projects for a short-term basis. This structure is for project-oriented businesses, such as aerospace, construction, or small manufacturers.</li>
                    <li>In the virtual structure, administration is the primary function performed, with other functions—such as marketing, engineering, production, and finance—outsourced to other companies or individuals. This structure can be quite attractive to small businesses and start-ups.</li>
                    <li>Creating an effective business organization structure should take the competition, the industry, compliance or legal requirements, investors, and lending sources into consideration.</li>

                    <li>Select two small businesses that market two very different products, for example, a small manufacturer and a restaurant. Contact the manager of each business and conduct a fifteen-minute interview about the organizational structure that has been chosen. Ask each manager to describe the existing organizational structure (drawing an organization chart), explain why that structure was chosen, and reflect on the effectiveness and efficiency of the structure. Also ask each manager whether any thoughts have been given to changing the existing structure.</li>
                    <li>Frank Rainsford has been, in effect, the CEO of Frank’s All-American BarBeQue since its inception. His major role has been that of restaurant manager, receiving support from his assistant manager Ed Tobor for the last fourteen years. Frank has two children, a son and daughter, who both worked in the restaurant as teenagers. His daughter has worked periodically at the restaurant since she graduated from high school. Frank’s son, who recently lost his job, has returned to work for his father. The son produced several plans to expand the business, including the opening of a second restaurant and the extensive use of social media. After careful consideration, Frank has decided to open a second restaurant, but this has presented him with a major problem—how to assign responsibilities to personnel. His son wants to be designated the restaurant manager of the second restaurant and made the vice president of marketing. Ed Tobor also wants to be the manager of the new restaurant. His daughter has expressed an interest in being the manager of either restaurant. How should Frank resolve this problem?</li>

                <li>Every small business must select a legal form of ownership. It is one of the first decisions that a small business owner must make.</li>
                <li>The most common forms of legal structure are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the corporation. An LLC is a relatively new business structure.</li>
                <li>When deciding on a legal structure, every small business owner must consider several important factors before making the choice.</li>
                <li>The sole proprietorship is the oldest, simplest, and cheapest form of business ownership. This business structure accounts for the largest number of businesses but the lowest amount of revenue. This is the choice for most small businesses.</li>
                <li>A partnership is two or more people voluntarily operating a business as co-owners for profit. There are general partnerships and limited partnerships.</li>
                <li>A corporation is an artificial person with most of the legal rights of a real person. Corporations make up about 20 percent of all businesses in the United States, but they account for almost 90 percent of the revenue.</li>
                <li>Small businesses that are incorporated outperform unincorporated small businesses in terms of profitability, employment growth, sales growth, and other measures.</li>
                <li>The LLC is a hybrid of a sole proprietorship and a corporation. It is the best choice for most small businesses.</li>

            <ol class="orderedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_l02">
                <li>Select three small businesses of different sizes: small, medium, and large. Interview the owners, asking each about the legal structure that the owner chose and why. If any of the businesses are sole proprietorships, ask the owner if an LLC was considered. If not, try to find out why it was not considered.</li>
                <li>Frank’s BarBeQue is currently a sole proprietorship. Frank’s son, Robert, is trying to persuade his father to either incorporate or become an LLC. Assume that you are Robert. Make a case for each legal structure and then make a recommendation to Frank. It is expected that you will go beyond the textbook in researching your response to this assignment.</li>

This term is more appropriate for large bureaucratic organizations that tend to view their personnel as a problem to be managed.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_p01">Because hiring a new employee is an expensive process, it is important to choose sources that have the greatest potential for reaching the people who will most likely be interested in what a small business has to offer. Unfortunately, it is not always possible to know what those sources are, so selecting a mix of sources makes good sense.</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s01_s02_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Internet.</strong> The Internet offers a wealth of places to advertise a job opportunity. <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.monster.com">Monster.com</a>, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.careerbuilder.com">CareerBuilder.com</a>, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.linkedin.com">LinkedIn.com</a> are among the largest and most well-known sites, but there may be local or regional job sites that might work better, particularly if a business is very small. A business will not have the resources to bring people in from great distances. If a business has a Facebook or a Twitter presence, this is another great place to let people know about job openings. There may also be websites that specialize in particular occupations.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Schools and colleges.</strong> Depending on the nature of the job, local schools and colleges are great sources for job candidates, particularly if the job is part time. Full-time opportunities may be perfect for the new high school or college graduate. It would be worth checking out college alumni offices as well because they often offer job services.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Employee referrals.</strong> Referrals are always worth consideration, if only on a preliminary basis. The employee making the referral knows the business and the person being referred. Going this route can significantly shorten the search process…if there is a fit.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Promotion from within.</strong> Promoting from within is a time-honored practice. The owner sends a positive signal to employees that there is room for advancement and management cares about its employees. It is significantly less costly and quicker than recruiting outside, candidates are easier to assess because more information is available, and it improves morale and organization loyalty.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_126">“When Is It Better to Promote from Within Your Company?,” <em class="emphasis">AllBusiness</em>, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce-management-hiring-recruitment/1502-1.html">www.allbusiness.com/human-resources/workforce -management-hiring-recruitment/1502-1.html</a>.</span> On the downside, there may be problems between the person who is promoted and former coworkers, and the organization will not benefit from the fresh ideas of someone hired from the outside.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Want ads.</strong> Want ads can be very effective for a small business, especially if a business is looking locally or regionally. The more dynamic the want ad, the more likely it will attract good candidates. Newspapers and local-reach magazines might be a business’s first thoughts but also consider advertising in the newsletters of relevant professional organizations and at the career services offices of local colleges, universities, and technical colleges.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p01">All small businesses want their employees to work better and smarter. In fact, the smaller a business is, the more efficient and effective it must be. Productivity is an issue in two places: the office and in manufacturing. Office productivity (which applies to all levels in the organization) is discussed in this section, and the role of technology is the focus. “Office” is used broadly to include, for example, physical offices, virtual offices, work situations that involve in-the-car time (e.g., realtors and salespeople), restaurant kitchens, and people who work on the sales floor in retail establishments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p02">Even the smallest of businesses can improve productivity by using technology, even though such use may be very limited in some instances. For example, goods and services needed to run a business can often be ordered online; e-mail can be used for customer and supplier communication; taxes can be filed online; and a simple software package like <em class="emphasis">Microsoft Communicator</em> allows intra- and extracompany communication via e-mail, text, and video. It will be the rare business that uses no technology.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s04_s04_p03">Some have referred to technology as the road map to small business success—helping grow the business, work smarter, attract more customers, enhance customer service, and stay ahead of the competition.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_183">“Technology: Your Roadmap to Small-Business Success,” <em class="emphasis">Intel</em>, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/world-ahead/world-ahead-small-business-success-article.html">www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/world-ahead/world-ahead-small -business-success-article.html</a>.</span> An important component of all this is high office productivity.

                    <li>Deciding to hire someone will always be a big step because there will be an immediate need to worry about payroll, benefits, unemployment, and numerous other issues.</li>

    </div>
    <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s01">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Value Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s01_p01">By definition, a small business is small. The CEO and the top management team have a much greater understanding of the tasks and operations of the entire business and what their employees are doing. (Sometimes their employees wish they did not have such a good knowledge of the tasks they, the employees, are supposed to be performing.) In a small business, it is much more likely for the CEO and the top management team to have a personalized relationship with their customer base. Sometimes this functions on a one-to-one basis and is predicated on a true sense of personal friendship. This intimacy between those at the top of a small business and their customers or clientele can yield tremendous benefits for both the business and the customers. Knowing the true needs of the customer on a personalized level greatly enhances the value produced by a business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s01_p02">Small business organizations are flatter and less bureaucratic. Sometimes they are less centralized. This enables frontline personnel to be closer to the customer, where they can better ascertain the needs of the customer and make decisions more quickly to satisfy those needs. This adds to the value of these businesses in the eyes of their customers because of a more positive customer experience.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s01_p03">In addition to being closer to the customers, the owner of a smaller business has a closer relationship with the employees. There generally is no need for a formal “human resources” department that bureaucratizes relationships. The owner knows the strengths and the weaknesses of the employees and will best use them in the business. The owner can develop personal relationships with employees that are impossible in larger organizations. This closeness can often translate into an intangible strength—loyalty. Employees who are happy with their employment will provide greater value to the customer.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash-Flow Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s02_p01">The simpler the organizational structure, the more positive will be the impact on cash flow. Having unnecessary positions will negatively impact small business operations in terms of not only costs but also efficiency and effectiveness.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s02_p02">Improper hiring and termination procedures will also adversely affect cash flow. Recruiting employees is an expensive process, so errors in the hiring process will be a drain on the cash flow of a business and, as a result, its profitability. Termination is a particularly sensitive process, so a careful and thoughtful procedure should be developed for carrying it out. Errors in either hiring or termination may open up a business to lawsuits, another major hit to cash flow and profitability.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s02_p03">Technology adoption for office productivity improvements (e.g., social networking, iPads, and smartphones) may adversely affect the cash flow in the short term, but (hopefully) the higher productivity should offset those losses in the longer term. As an example, recall Lloyd’s Construction in Eagan, Minnesota, from <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch01#cadden_1.0-ch01">Chapter 1 "Foundations for Small Business"</a>. The company switched to a <strong class="emphasis bold">smartphone</strong> system that allowed for integrated data entry and communication. The company reduced its routing and fuel costs by as much as 30 percent, and they estimated that they saved $1 million on a $50,000 investment.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_207">Jonathan Blum, “Running an Entire Business from Smartphones,” <em class="emphasis">CNN Money</em>, March 12, 2008, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://money.cnn.com/2008/03/11/smbusiness/mobile_phone_software.fsb/index.htm">money.cnn.com/2008/03/11/smbusiness/mobile_phone_software.fsb/index.htm</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p01">New technology solutions are being introduced every day, many of them potentially very useful for small businesses. This chapter discussed the productivity enhancement possibilities offered by social networking, the iPad, smartphones, and collaboration tools, but the discussion was only the tip of the iceberg. Technology is so pervasive in today’s workplace that ignoring it will be done at each business’s peril. Mobile technology is now even pervading the hiring process; the world of recruiting via mobile technology is moving at the speed of light. The result? More and more organizations are trying to figure out how to start using mobile devices to recruit new employees.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_208">Julie Bos, “Top Trends in Staffing: Is Your Organization Prepared for What Lies Ahead?,” <em class="emphasis">Workforce Management</em> 90, no. 2 (2011): 33–38.</span> The prospect of targeting all populations of people is an exciting—but certainly challenging—one.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p02">Another interesting technology product is talent management software developed by <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.taleo.com/solutions/taleo-business-edition">Taleo</a>, which is targeted to the small business to simplify recruiting, hiring, and performance management with “unmatched flexibility.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_209">“Taleo Business Edition,” <em class="emphasis">Taleo.com</em>, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.taleo.com/solutions/taleo-business-edition">www.taleo.com/solutions/taleo-business-edition</a>.</span> There are undoubtedly other similar products available. The point is that this is an example of the small business technology solutions that are available for exploration and consideration.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p03">The e-environment is a small business facilitator extraordinaire. The web is a fabulous place, making collaboration and communication so much better and faster. It has opened the door to enhanced productivity, and a potentially important part of that is the virtual employee. Small businesses should seriously consider the advantages of virtual employees because they can help the small business expand its reach, increase employee morale, and contribute to a much better work-life balance.</p>

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p04">John owns a very successful electronics business. He has been in business for only three years and already has several large stores. He has seventy-five part- and full-time employees. The business thrives on a sales force that must be able to close deals, particularly on high-priced items.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p05">Jennifer is John’s administrative assistant. She has been with him from the beginning, and John considers her to be a vital element in the success of the business. He had wooed her away from another large electronics chain. On Tuesday, Jennifer requested a private meeting with him. She arrived at the meeting clearly distressed. He asked her to sit down and tell him what was troubling her. She struggled not to cry but could not hold back the tears. She recounted the following story.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p06">Ed Smith, a salesperson, had for the last five weeks been making inappropriate and suggestive comments to her. She told John that at first she tried to dismiss and deflect Ed’s comments with humor, and the humor clearly indicated that she had no interest. The result was that the comments became more frequent, more aggressive, and more vulgar. At this point (last Friday), Jennifer indicated to Ed that she found his remarks offensive and harassing. He laughed and, in the intervening days, continued the remarks, which became even more progressively lewd. It was Jennifer’s opinion that Ed was incapable of understanding how inappropriate his behavior was. She believes that his presence creates a significantly hostile working environment for her and other women. She thinks it would be best for the organization if Ed were fired immediately.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p07">John expressed his profound sympathy to Jennifer and said that he would speak to Ed right away. This clearly was not what Jennifer wanted to hear. She left John’s office simply stating, “It’s either him or me.”</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s05_s03_p08">Although John was extremely sympathetic to Jennifer’s position, he recognized that he had to speak to Ed to protect himself. Further, John had to consider the fact that Ed was unquestionably his best salesperson. Two hours later, John called Ed into his office and related Jennifer’s story. Ed laughed it off as harmless word play, even going as far as saying, “Could you possibly see me being interested in a woman who looks like she does?” He then countered with, “Look. You know I’m your best salesman, and if I’m fired because of some slanderous comments, I’ll sue.” He then stormed out of John’s office.</p>
