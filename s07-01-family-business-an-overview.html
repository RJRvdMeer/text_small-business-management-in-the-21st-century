            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch03_s01_s02_s01_l01">
                <li>One of the popular misconceptions about family businesses is that they are unable to adapt easily to increasing competitiveness and technological progress. The reality is that family businesses frequently have the advantage of entrepreneurial spirit, flexibility, and opportunism.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_010">“Myths and Realities of Family Business,” 2002, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf">www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf</a>.</span>
</li>
                <li>It is believed by some that family firms are “too soft” and rarely reach their potential. The reality is that family businesses actually outperform public companies. Oftentimes, the marketplace forces public companies to make short-term decisions, whereas a family business has the advantage of having more freedom to make its decisions. Family businesses can adapt to market fluctuations more easily because they can afford to be patient. They have common goals, shared values, and a commitment to brand building.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_011">“Myths and Realities of Family Business,” 2002, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf">www.insead.edu/discover_insead/publications/docs/IQ03.pdf</a>.</span>
</li>
                <li>Family-owned businesses are often seen as ideal because family members form a “grounded and loyal foundation” for the company, and family members tend to exhibit more dedication to their common goals. “Having a certain level of intimacy among the owners of a business can help bring about familiarity with the company and having family members around provides a built-in support system that should ensure teamwork and solidarity.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_012">Alexis Writing, “Pros and Cons of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Chron.com</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-family-business-409.html">smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-family-business-409.html</a>.</span>
</li>
                <li>The culture of a family business is very different from that of a company you will find on Wall Street. “Family businesses frequently take a very long-term point of view. They’ll make investments that they don’t expect to pay off for 5 or 15 or 25 years…Culture in a family business is more frequently based on very personal and emotional values. It’s stronger because there are deeper roots and closer connections to the history of the company.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_013">Margaret Steen, “The Decision Tree of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Graduate School of Business</em>, August 2006, accessed June 21, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html">www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html</a>.</span>

                <li>Family businesses are becoming more and more attractive to undergraduate business students who face a bleak job and salary outlook for new grads.

                <li>There is a common misperception that family businesses are less professional and rigorous in their behavior because of the relational nature of the businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_015">“American Family Business Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Mass Mutual Financial Group</em>, 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf">www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf</a>.</span> However, like all other businesses, family businesses face global competition and rapidly changing markets. This creates more pressure on those who join to make sure that they produce. “This emphasis on professionalism has made family businesses both more daunting and more attractive—and has created new interest in them, from family members, outsiders, and business school students.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_016">Margaret Steen, “The Decision Tree of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Graduate School of Business</em>, August 2006, accessed June 21, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html">www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html</a>.</span>

                <li>Many family-owned businesses tend to be stable and optimistic, even when economic times are uncertain. They seem to be better able to weather economic difficulties and stabilize the economy than their nonfamily counterparts.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_017">“American Family Business Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Mass Mutual Financial Group</em>, 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf">www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf</a>.</span> However, this is a function of the industry and the size of the business.</li>
                <li>In general, family businesses feel that they are stronger because family members are involved in their activities. Family owners believe that their family members can be trusted, will work harder, and care more.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_018">“The Family Business Survey 2008/2009,” <em class="emphasis">Praxity</em>, 2009, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://praxityprod.awecomm.com/News/2009/Pages/UKFamilyBusinessSurvey.aspx">http://praxityprod.awecomm.com/News/2009/Pages/UKFamilyBusinessSurvey.aspx</a>.</span> This can help create competitive advantage in the marketplace.</li>
                <li>Family businesses may be more open to flexible or part-time schedules or choosing your hours.

</li>
                <li>Family businesses tend to operate more ethically. In fact, many family businesses believe that their ethical standards are more stringent than those of their competitors. In addition, family businesses are often deeply embedded in their communities, and this proximity is seen as an important factor that increases the likelihood of ethical decision making and moral behavior.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_020">“American Family Business Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Mass Mutual Financial Group</em>, 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf">www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf</a>.</span> As members of the local community, any ethical problems with a family business will be quickly visible.</li>
                <li>Family businesses also exhibit more social responsibility than their competitors. This has been attributed to their concern about image and local reputation<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_021">“American Family Business Survey,” <em class="emphasis">Mass Mutual Financial Group</em>, 2007, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf">www.massmutual.com/mmfg/pdf/afbs.pdf</a>.</span> as well as their closeness to the community.</li>
                <li>Family businesses may incur lower costs because of the greater willingness of family members to make financial sacrifices for the sake of the business. Accepting lower pay than they would get elsewhere to help the business in the longer term or deferring wages in a cash-flow crisis are examples of family altruistic behavior.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_022">“Advantages of Family Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">Business Link</em>, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1073792650&amp;type=RESOURCES">www.businesslink.gov.uk/bdotg/action/detail?itemId=1073792650&amp;type= RESOURCES</a>.</span>

When Freud was asked what he considered to be the secret of a full life, he gave a three-word answer: ‘<em class="emphasis">Lieben und arbeiten</em> [to love and to work].’ For most people, the two most important things in their lives are their families and their work. It is easy to understand the compelling power of organizations that combine both. Being in a family firm affects all the participants. The role of chairman of the board is different when the company was founded by your father and when your mother and siblings sit around the table at board meetings, just as they sat around the dinner table. The job of a CEO is different when the vice president in the next office is also a younger sister. The role of partner is different when the other partner is a spouse or a child. The role of sales representative is different when you cover the same territory that your parent did twenty-five years earlier, and your grandparent twenty-five years before that. Even walking through the door on your first day of work on an assembly line or in a billing office is different if the name over the door is your own.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_030">Kelin E.

                <li>Family businesses tend to be stable organizations. Although this is a good thing in many instances, stability can also make it difficult to change. A new, younger family member coming into the business will find tradition and structure. Changing that is not simple. The key to changing a family business lies in defining tradition in terms of the company’s core values, not in specific ways of doing things.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_031">Margaret Steen, “The Decision Tree of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Graduate School of Business</em>, August 2006, accessed June 21, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html">www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html</a>.</span>

                <li>Family closeness can lead to sibling rivalry or problems when both the parent and the child want control. By the third or fourth generation, with many cousins possibly sharing ownership, governance can become very complicated.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_032">Margaret Steen, “The Decision Tree of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Stanford Graduate School of Business</em>, August 2006, accessed June 21, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html">www-prd-0.gsb.stanford.edu/news/bmag/sbsm0608/feature_familybiz.html</a>.</span>

                <li>There may be times when the interests of a family member conflict with the interests of the business. One family member may want to expand the business, but other family members may not share this person’s desire. The needs of the business are not in sync with the needs of the family.</li>
                <li>Family ties have a downside. Family members will frequently be expected to work harder, make more of a commitment, and get paid less than other employees in the business.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_033">“The Family Business Survey 2008/2009,” <em class="emphasis">Praxity</em>, 2009, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://praxityprod.awecomm.com/News/2009/Pages/UKFamilyBusinessSurvey.aspx">http://praxityprod.awecomm.com/News/2009/Pages/UKFamilyBusinessSurvey.aspx</a>.</span>

                <li>Family business owners may automatically promote someone from the family or give family members a job even if they do not have adequate skills for the job.

                <li>Relationships between parents and children or among siblings have a tendency to deteriorate due to communication problems. “This dysfunctional behavior can result in judgments, criticism and lack of support.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_035">Alexis Writing, “Pros and Cons of Family Business,” <em class="emphasis">Chron.com</em>, 2010, accessed October 8, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-family-business-409.html">smallbusiness.chron.com/pros-cons-family-business-409.html</a>.</span>

                <li>Some family businesses may have difficulty attracting and keeping highly qualified managers. “Qualified managers may avoid family firms due to the exclusive <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">succession</a><span class="glossdef">Passing the business to the next generation.</span></span>, limited potential for professional growth, lack of perceived professionalism, and limitations on wealth transfer.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_038">David G.

                <li>The “spoiled kid syndrome” often occurs in a family business. The business owner may feel guilty because his devotion to the business takes away from the attention he should be giving to his children.

                <li>Family businesses frequently have a confusing organization, with “messy structure and no clear division of tasks.” Authority and responsibility lines are unclear; jobs may overlap; executives may hold a number of different jobs; and the decision-making hierarchy may be completely ignored, existing only to be bypassed.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn03_047">Manfred F.

He has returned to the family business and is very enthusiastic about expanding the business. He has identified four options: (a) expanding the restaurant either at its current site or elsewhere in Fairfield; (b) opening several similar-sized restaurants in nearby towns; (c) using the Internet to expand sales; and (d) expanding the sales of Frank’s sauces from a local store to a regional supermarket chain. Any one of these ideas would represent a change from his father’s business model. Given that he had not expressed any interest in the management of the business, how should he go about approaching his father with these ideas? If the company expands, should Robert approach his sister and her husband about taking a more active role in the business? What should their roles be?</li>
