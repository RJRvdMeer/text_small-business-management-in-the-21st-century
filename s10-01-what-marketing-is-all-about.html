Marketing is also about promotional activities such as advertising and sales that let customers know about the goods and services that are available for purchase. Successful marketing generates revenue that pays for all other company operations. Without marketing, no business can last very long. It is that important and that simple—and it applies to small business.</p>

However, company efforts should be integrated and coordinated in such a way to meet organizational objectives and achieve profitability.

Customers have higher expectations and more choices than ever before. This means that marketers have to listen more closely than ever before.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_007">Charles W. Lamb, Joseph F.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p02">Sam Walton, the founder of Walmart, put it best when he said, “There is only one boss: the customer.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s01_s01_p04">Small business is in a very strong position in keeping with the societal marketing concept.

Small businesses are natural for the holistic marketing concept because the bureaucracy of large corporations does not burden them. The size of small businesses makes it possible, perhaps imperative, to have fluid and well-integrated operations.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_p01">The definition of <strong class="emphasis bold">marketing</strong> specifically includes the notion that offerings must have value to customers, clients, partners, and society at large.

Such a simple definition can be misleading, however, because the creation of customer value will always be a challenge—most notably because a company must know its customers extremely well to offer them what they need and want. This is complicated because customers could be seeking <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">functional value</a><span class="glossdef">A product or a service performs a utilitarian purpose.</span></span> (a product or a service performs a utilitarian purpose), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">social value</a><span class="glossdef">A sense of relationship with other groups through images or symbols.</span></span> (a sense of relationship with other groups through images or symbols), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">emotional value</a><span class="glossdef">The ability to evoke an emotional or an affective response.</span></span> (the ability to evoke an emotional or an affective response), <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">epistemic value</a><span class="glossdef">Offering novelty or fun.</span></span> (offering novelty or fun), or <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">conditional value</a><span class="glossdef">Derived from a particular context or a sociocultural setting, such as shared holidays.</span></span> (derived from a particular context or a sociocultural setting, such as shared holidays)—or some combination of these types of value.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s01_s02_p02">Marketing plays a key role in creating and delivering value to a customer. Customer value can be offered in a myriad of ways. In addition to superlative ice cream, for example, the local ice cream shop can offer a frequent purchase card that allows for a free ice cream cone after the purchase of fifteen ice cream products at the regular price. Your favorite website can offer free shipping for Christmas purchases and/or pay for returns. Zappos.com offers free shipping both ways for its shoes. The key is for a company to know its consumers so well that it can provide the value that will be of interest to them.</p>

A target market is one or more segments (e.g., income or income + gender + occupation) that have been chosen as the focus for business operations. The selection of a target market is important to any small business because it enables the business to be more precise with its marketing efforts, thereby being more cost-effective. This will increase the chances for success. The idea behind a target market is that it will be the best match for a company’s products and services. This, in turn, will help maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of a company’s marketing efforts:</p>

            <p class="para editable" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s01_s04_p02">It is not feasible to go after all customers, because customers have different wants, needs and tastes. Some customers want to be style leaders. They will always buy certain styles and usually pay a high price for them. Other customers are bargain hunters. They try to find the lowest price. Obviously, a company would have difficulty targeting both of these market segments simultaneously with one type of product. For example, a company with premium products would not appeal to bargain shoppers…</p>

More commonly known as “the four Ps,” the traditional marketing mix refers to the combination of product, price, promotion, and place (distribution). Each component is controlled by the company, but they are all affected by factors both internal and external to the company. Additionally, each element of the marketing mix is impacted by decisions made for the other elements. What this means is that an alteration of one element in the marketing mix will likely alter the other elements as well. They are inextricably interrelated. No matter the size of the business or organization, there will always be a marketing mix. The marketing mix is discussed in more detail in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch07#cadden_1.0-ch07">Chapter 7 "Marketing Strategy"</a>. A brief overview is presented here.</p>

Examples of product decisions include design and styling, sizes, variety, packaging, warranties and guarantees, ingredients, quality, safety, brand name and image, brand logo, and support services. In the case of a services business, product decisions also include the design and delivery of the service, with delivery including such things as congeniality, promptness, and efficiency.

Channel pricing occurs when different prices are charged depending on where the customer purchases the product. A paper manufacturer may charge different prices for paper purchased by businesses, school bookstores, and local stationery stores. Customer segment pricing refers to charging different prices for different groups. A local museum may charge students and senior citizens less for admission.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_014">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 401.</span></p>
