Fisher entered the global market four years ago as a way to expand the business. He was able to finance the expansion internally, so financing was not an issue.</p>

He designed and built his own horizontal drilling rig and, shortly thereafter, began focusing on making Center Rock an air and rock drilling supplier and manufacturer. He recognized the need for a manufacturing company that was reactive to customer needs, with innovative products and 24/7 customer service and support. Working with his high-tech engineering and design team, Fisher created a company different from its competitors with its unique products and service capabilities.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_p01">Although small businesses make up a disproportionately large share of the number of companies that export and import, this represents only about 1 percent of the total number of small businesses. Thus many small businesses have yet to compete globally. The opportunities are there. “So much of what America makes is in great demand,” said US Commerce Secretary Gary Locke in an interview, adding further that the growth potential for small companies is outside the United States. Dale Hayes, vice president of US marketing for UPS concurs, observing that the demand for high-quality American products is huge.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_002">Paul Davidson, “Small Businesses Look Across Borders to Add Markets,” <em class="emphasis">USA Today</em>, April 12, 2011, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-04-06-small-businesses-go-international.htm">www.usatoday.com/money/economy/2011-04-06-small-businesses-go-international.htm</a>; Rieva Lesonsky, “Increased Opportunities for Small-Business Exports,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, June 27, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/opportunities-small-business-exports.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/opportunities-small-business -exports.html</a>.</span> It may be that a small business is already competing globally because foreign-owned companies are competing in our own backyards.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_003">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_p02">Yet the global marketplace is not relevant to most small businesses. Given that 99 percent of the small businesses in the United States are not operating globally—preferring to grow (if they want to) locally, regionally, and perhaps nationally—it is reasonable to conclude that going global will interest only a few. Those few, however, must undertake careful analyses before jumping into the global arena.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Small Business Global Presence</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p01">It may seem to many that the global market is the domain of the large corporations, but the statistics tell a very different story.

            <li>Nearly 100 percent (99.2 percent) of exporting wholesalers were small businesses, which is 61.1 percent of the sector’s $218 billion in exports.</li>
            <li>Of other companies with exports, 96.9 percent were small businesses. These companies include manufacturing companies of prepackaged software and books, freight forwarders and other transportation service firms, business services, engineering and management services, gas and oil extraction companies, coal mining companies, and communication services, to name a few.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p02">This tells us that small businesses are very active in the global marketplace, and small business success in international markets is extremely important to the welfare of the United States.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_006">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span> Although it is true that small businesses are major users of imported goods, the focus of this chapter is on small business exporting because exporting can be an effective way to diversify the customer base, manage market fluctuations, grow, and become more competitive.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_007">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p03">Small businesses are limited in the products and the services that they export. Small business exports are concentrated in four main product categories: computers and electronic products, chemicals, machinery, and transportation equipment. However, the leading product categories in terms of market share were wood products, apparel and accessories, tobacco products, beverages, and leather products.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_008">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p04">Although the United States is one of the world’s largest participants in global services trade, very little information exists with respect to services exports by small businesses. What is known is that it is increasingly common for most US services firms to establish a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">foreign affiliate</a><span class="glossdef">A branch or a subsidiary of the parent company established outside the national boundaries of the parent company’s home market.</span></span>—a branch or a subsidiary of the parent company established outside the national boundaries of the parent company’s home market—because most services are better supplied in close proximity to the principal or final customers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_009">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span> Additionally, in some business sectors, foreign regulations may restrict the delivery of some services to affiliates only. For example, to comply with domestic solvency requirements, some countries require that personal lines of insurance be carried out only by affiliates. Another example is the protection of intellectual property rights. This is often accomplished through the services of affiliates, thus intellectual property is kept in-house.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_010">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s01_s01_p05">What is particularly interesting is that most of the service exporting occurs in businesses with 0–19 employees, with the least service exporting done by small businesses with 300–499 employees. This may be the exact opposite of what you would expect.</p>

For example, a small business will incur additional costs, such as modifying its product or its packaging (perhaps even changing the name of its product so that it does not convey negative meanings outside the United States), developing new promotional materials, administrative costs (such as hiring staff to launch the export expansion and dedicating personnel for traveling), traveling to foreign locations (very important), and shipping.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_021">Laurel Delaney, “A How-To on Expanding Your Business Globally,” <em class="emphasis">The Global Small Business Blog</em>, January 11, 2011, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://borderbuster.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-to-on-expanding-your-business.html">borderbuster.blogspot.com/2011/01/how-to-on-expanding-your-business.html</a>; Strategic Name Development, Inc., “Global Linguistic Analysis” (2011), accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.namedevelopment.com/global-linguistic-analysis.html">www.namedevelopment.com/global-linguistic-analysis.html</a>.</span> It may also be necessary for the owner to subordinate short-term profits to long-term gains, wait longer for payments, apply for additional financing, and obtain special export licenses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_022">“Breaking into the Trade Game: A Small Business Guide to Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, 2005, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_entire.pdf</a>.</span> There will be differences in consumer needs, wants, and usage patterns for products; differences in consumer response to the elements of the marketing mix and differences in the legal environment may conflict with those of the United States.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_023">“Global Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">SmallBusiness.com</em>, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbusiness.com/wiki/Global_marketing">smallbusiness.com/wiki/Global_marketing</a>.</span> Then, of course, there are cultural and language issues along with the all-too-familiar fear of the unknown.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_024">Rieva Lesonsky, “Increased Opportunities for Small-Business Exports,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, June 27, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/opportunities-small-business-exports.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/06/opportunities-small-business-exports.html</a>.</span> A recent survey of exporting and nonexporting members of the National Small Business Association (NSBA) and the Small Business Exporters Association (SBEA) reported the following main barriers to small businesses selling their goods and/or services to foreign customers:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_025">“2010 Small Business Exporting Survey,” <em class="emphasis">NSBA and SBEA</em>, March 11, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nsba.biz/docs/2010_small_business_exporting_survey_001.pdf">www.nsba.biz/docs/2010_small_business_exporting_survey _001.pdf</a>.</span></p>

If a business’s financial situation is weak, the timing may not be right for becoming an exporter…but perhaps exporting makes sense in the future. In any case, very careful thinking should precede the decision to export.</p>

                <li>The product or the company name must translate flawlessly to the new target market so that it does not convey an unintended, perhaps very negative, meaning. One of the most well-known examples of a translation blunder is the Chevy Nova. In Spanish, “nova” means “no go.”</li>
                <li>The package label may need to be changed.

A small business that is looking to go global—or is already there—will encounter channel structures that range from a minimally developed marketing infrastructure, such as in emerging markets, to highly complex, multilayered systems, such as in Japan.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_088">Philip R.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s02_s04_s04_p01">It is understandable that a small business owner may want to use the same integrated marketing communications (IMC) programs used in the home market to inform customers in foreign markets and persuade them to buy. This “one voice” approach offers the advantage of enabling a business or a product to gain broader recognition in the global marketplace; it also helps reduce costs, minimize redundancies in personnel, and maximize the speed of implementation.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_089">John M.

Cultural, social, language, and legal differences from country to country will usually make it necessary to modify IMC messages to not offend current or prospective customers. Modification is more of a challenge for the small business because the resources needed to make the changes are more limited.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s02_s04_s04_p02">A business communicates with its customers through some combination of its website, advertising, publicity, public relations, sales promotion, sales personnel, e-mail, and social media. The actual mix will be a function of the selected country or countries. For example, in some less-developed countries, the major portion of the promotional effort in rural and less-accessible parts of the market is sales promotion; in other markets, product sampling works especially well when the product concept is new or has a very small market share.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_090">Philip R.

Consumers respond in terms of their culture, style, feelings, value systems, attitudes, beliefs, and perceptions.

However, a business will not know that for sure until it does the proper research before making a decision. Consider the characteristics of the target market, how the market uses media in that country, and which media are actually available. Some countries do not have commercial television, and some do not have advertising in newspapers.

Currency exchange rates change daily, and they are important because currency fluctuations can present additional problems for the small business looking to go global. The appreciation and depreciation of a currency will have an effect on the prices of goods and services. For example, as the dollar declines in value against the euro, the price of goods and services from the European Union for US customers will increase, likely reducing their purchases.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_112">John M.

        <h2 class="title editable block">Sources of Financing</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s02_s07_p01">How a business finances an export project is often a critical factor in its success. Financing decisions extend to working capital and export transactions. Working capital is needed to finance operations before and after a sale, and money is needed to sustain a business until it is paid for the goods and services that have been provided (export transactions). The <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.wita.org">International Trade Association</a> in the US Department of Commerce identifies the following factors as important to consider when making financing decisions.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_115">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed. (Washington, DC: International Trade Association, 2008), 193–94.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The need for financing to make the sale.</strong> Offering favorable payment terms can make a product more competitive.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The length of time the product is being financed.</strong> The term of the loan required determines how long a business will have to wait before the buyer pays for the product, which will influence the choice of how to finance the transaction.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The cost of different methods of financing.</strong> Interest rates and fees will vary, and a business should probably expect to assume some of the financing costs. Before providing an invoice to the buyer, a business must understand how these costs will affect price and profit.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The risks associated with financing the transaction.</strong> The riskier the transaction, the more difficult and costly it will be for a business to finance it because there will likely be a higher chance for default. The level of risk will be influenced by several things, not the least of which is the political and economic stability of the buyer’s country. In risky situations, the financing provider may require the most secure method of payment—a letter of credit or export credit insurance.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The need for preshipment financing and postshipment working capital.</strong> Working capital could experience unexpected and severe strains with the production of an unusually large order or a surge of orders. Inadequate working capital can limit exporting growth—even during normal periods.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s02_s07_s01_p01">Small businesses have reported that problems with access to financing for their exporting operations are a major barrier to exporting. The difficulties they experience in obtaining both trade finance and working capital often prevent small businesses from financing purchases by foreign buyers. This encourages foreign buyers to choose suppliers that are able to extend credit. Small businesses must also face the perception of lending institutions that they are a higher risk than larger companies coupled with a lack of familiarity with exporting by community banks.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_116">“Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises: Overview of Participation in U.S. Exports,” <em class="emphasis">US International Trade Commission</em>, January 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf">www.usitc.gov/publications/332/pub4125.pdf</a>.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s02_s07_s01_p02">Despite any anticipated difficulties, small businesses need to find export financing. They can look for financing in several places. The first place to look is internally. Does it already have the funds to finance global efforts? If the answer is yes, then all is well. This was the case for Center Rock, the small business featured at the beginning of this chapter. If the answer is no, which will most likely be the case, it will be necessary to look for external financing. A range of options is available for small businesses to consider (see <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch15_s02_s07_s01_t01">Table 15.3 "Sources of Export Financing for the Small Business"</a>). As you will see, most financing sources are available from the government. A small business must become familiar with the financing, insurance, and grant programs that are available to help it finance transactions and carry out export operations.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_117">“6 Steps to Begin Exporting,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.gov/content/6-steps-begin-exporting">www.sba.gov/content/6-steps-begin-exporting</a>.</span></p>

                    <li>Expanding into global markets introduces new complexities into small business operations.</li>
                    <li>The decision to go global should be based on an assessment of the ways to export, an analysis of the industry and a particular company, marketing and cultural factors, legal and political conditions, currency exchange rates, and sources of financing.</li>
                    <li>There are two basic ways to export: direct or indirect. In direct exporting, a small business exports directly to a customer who is interested in buying the product. Indirect exporting involves using a middleman for marketing and selling the product in the target market.</li>
                    <li>Industry analysis involves looking at where an industry currently is and the trends and directions predicted over the next three years so that a business can try to determine how competitive an industry is in the global market.</li>
                    <li>It is important to honestly self-evaluate a business to determine whether it is ready to go global or not.</li>
                    <li>It will generally be necessary to adapt the marketing mix to the global market in general and different countries in particular.</li>
                    <li>Legal issues include international trade laws, tax laws, and local regulations.</li>
                    <li>No small business can conduct global business without understanding the influence of the political environments in which it will be operating.</li>
                    <li>Currency exchange rates are important because currency fluctuations can present additional problems for a small business that is looking to go global. In particular, the appreciation and depreciation of a currency will have an effect on the prices of goods and services.</li>
                    <li>How a business finances an export project is often a critical factor in its success.</li>
                    <li>Working capital is needed before and after the sale, and money is needed until the goods and services that have been provided have been paid for.</li>
                    <li>Many—perhaps most—of the sources for small business exporting activity are governmental.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Getting internal buy-in.</strong> Because going overseas to do business is a larger undertaking than many businesses realize, make sure that senior management and the people who are responsible for implementing and supporting the overseas effort know what the goals are and what is expected of them with respect to oversight and management. Knowing how much senior management time should be and could be allocated is an important part of getting internal buy-in. Look for support from people in all functions of the business.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Making sure that the full costs of overseas hiring are understood.</strong> If people from overseas will be hired, employment regulations and practices are very different. For example, outside the United States, employment benefits often represent a larger percentage of an employee’s salary than in the United States; in the European Union, for example, a full-blown employment contract is needed, not just an offer letter. This tilts the balance of power to the employee at the expense of the company, making termination very difficult. Understanding the full ramifications of hiring people outside the United States has significant implications for a company’s financial success.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Thinking about how the business will manage overseas employees’ expectations.</strong> Different time zones and countries wreak havoc with keeping employees on the same page. Employees hired locally may have very different ideas about what is considered acceptable than a US employee does. Unless expectations and responsibilities are clearly conveyed at the beginning, problems will undoubtedly arise. They may anyway, but perhaps they will not be as serious.</li>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Cash in advance.</strong> This is the ideal method of payment because a company is relieved of collection problems and has immediate use of the money. Unfortunately, it tends to be an option only when the manufacturing process is specialized, lengthy, or capital intensive and requires partial or progress payments. Wire transfers are commonly used, and many exporters accept credit cards.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Documentary letter of credit.</strong> This is an internationally recognized instrument issued by a bank on behalf of its client, the purchaser. A letter of credit represents the bank’s guarantee to pay the seller, provided that the conditions specified in the letter are fulfilled.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Documentary collection or draft.</strong> This involves the use of a draft, drawn by the seller on the buyer. It requires the buyer to pay the face amount either on sight (sight draft) or on a specified date in the future (time draft). The draft is an unconditional order to make payment in accordance with its terms, which specify the documents needed before title to the goods will be passed. All terms of payment should be clearly specified so that confusion and delay are avoided.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Open account.</strong> With an open account, the exporter bills the customer, who is then expected to pay under agreed-on terms at a future date after the goods are manufactured and delivered (usually with fifteen, thirty, or sixty days). This payment method works well if the buyer is well established, has a long and favorable payment record, or has been thoroughly checked for being creditworthy. This approach is considered risky in international business because a business has limited recourse if debts are unpaid. Small businesses considering this option must examine the political, economic, and commercial risks very thoroughly.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consignment sales.</strong> Goods are shipped to a foreign distributor, which sells them on behalf of the exporter. Title to the goods remains with the exporter until they are sold, at which point payment is sent to the exporter. The exporter has the greatest risk and least control over the goods with this method, and payment may take a while. Risk insurance should be seriously considered with consignment sales.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s04_p03">When buyers default on their payments, it can be time-consuming, difficult, and expensive to obtain payments. A business should contact the buyer and try to negotiate payment. If negotiation fails and the amount of the debt is large enough to make a difference in that business, obtain the assistance and advice of the business’s bank, legal counsel, and the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://trade.gov/cs/">US Commercial Service</a>, an organization that can resolve payment problems informally.

            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s03_s06_l01">
                <li>Before taking a business global, desire to pursue export markets for good rather than frivolous reasons.</li>
                <li>Management commitment must be present for successful global operations.</li>
                <li>A business must decide on some kind of structure to handle its global side. It should be dedicated to ensuring that export sales are adequately serviced.</li>
                <li>Getting internal buy-in is critical.</li>
                <li>A business will need to select the best market(s) to enter. Although Canada, Japan, and Mexico are the largest markets for US products, these countries may not be the best markets for specific products or services.</li>
                <li>Tariffs and nontariff trade barriers can pose serious constraints.</li>
                <li>A business must decide how to enter a foreign market. For example, it can choose direct and indirect exporting, strategic alliances, JVs, and direct foreign investment.</li>
                <li>Being paid in full and on time is of obvious importance, especially considering the difficulties a business will encounter in collecting an unpaid international debt. The most secure method of payment is cash in advance. The least secure is an open account.</li>
                <li>Learning and understanding the business etiquette of the country or countries to which a business is exporting is a very important part of building business relationships.</li>
                <li>A carefully researched export plan is a source of direction, and it will help a business act on—rather than react to—the challenges and risks it will encounter in global business.</li>

Compare the home pages of these sites to the US home page—even though you will not understand the language (unless you are bilingual). Look at the graphics, layout, and uses of color. What are the similarities? What are the differences? To what would you attribute the differences? How would these similarities and differences inform the design of a small business website for conducting global business?</li>

            <li>Understand how to contribute to customer value in exporting activities.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Value Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p01">Always remember that customers make the decision about whether the appropriate value is present, and that value will always be as they perceive it. Carefully adapting a product to the targeted country for an exporting venture is an important first step in providing customer value. This means knowing about the sources of value in a product or a service and then acting on them. It can mean a minor product adaptation—for example, serving beer in McDonald’s in Germany or wine in McDonald’s in France and Italy—or a new twist on distribution—for example, Procter &amp; Gamble selling shampoo in single-use tubes in newsstands in India. Although these are large-company examples, the experiences can be easily translated into small business exporting practice.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p02">Another important source of customer value is the company website. Whether the website is the only selling platform of a business or is part of a brick-and-click exporting business, foreign buyers are much more likely to buy if a business’s website is in their language. Although translation and country-specific sites can be a costly proposition, the text, graphics, and colors of the website can either enhance or detract from an exporting business. A small business owner should find out what organizational services and website designers can provide assistance. It may be possible to link the website to the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.translate.google.com/">Google translation tool</a> to get a rough translation in seconds.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_145">Anita Campbell, “How to Make Your Website Ready for International Business,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, October 29, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/10/website-ready-international-business.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/10/website-ready-international-business.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p03">Once a sale is made, do not make the mistake of thinking that it is the end of the relationship between the business and an overseas customer. Providing after-sale service must be an integral part of a company’s export strategy from the very beginning.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_146">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed. (Washington, DC: International Trade Association, 2008), 219.</span> This service should include regular thank-yous for their business; a plan for regular communication; and offering customers 24/7 availability via some combination of fax, Twitter, e-mail alerts, a wiki, a Skype account, and telephone voicemail services where messages can be retrieved around the clock. This level of access will be of great value to foreign customers because it lets them know that you are reliable, dependable, ready to serve, and willing to minimize risk. It is this proper care and feeding of customers that will keep them coming back because the business provides value that makes it worth their while.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_147">Laurel Delaney, “Building Global Bonds One Customer at a Time,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, June 27, 2008, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2008/06/global-customer-bonds.html">smallbiztrends.com/2008/06/global-customer-bonds.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s01_p04">There is something else to consider as well. Research has shown that global online shoppers demand live customer service, with this service being more important than price.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_148">“Webinar: Online Retail and the ROI of Live Help—Why Global Online Shoppers Demand Live Customer Service,” accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.retailcustomerexperience.com/whitepapers/2508/Webinar-Online-Retail-and-the-ROI-of-Live-Help-Why-Global-Online-Shoppers-Demand-Live-Customer-Service">www.retailcustomerexperience.com/whitepapers/2508/Webinar-Online-Retail-and -the-ROI-of-Live-Help-Why-Global-Online-Shoppers-Demand-Live-Customer-Service</a>.</span> This has implications not only for how customer service is designed for the targeted country for exports but for buyers from other countries as well.</p>

    <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s02">
        <h2 class="title editable block">Cash-Flow Implications</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_p01">A small business exporter will face the same cash-flow challenges that affect any small business, but being an exporter presents additional cash-flow challenges that are unique to selling products overseas. One of these challenges comes from the value-added tax (VAT) in Europe. Having the proper VAT registration can be key because all non–European Union businesses must collect and remit the VAT on applicable transactions. A business is required to charge the VAT, and compliance requires periodic VAT filings, which means keeping VAT records on file and available for inspection by local tax authorities and anyone else who has reason and authority to inspect them. A failure to comply can result in significant penalties and cash-flow problems.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_149">Denise O’Berry, “Is Now the Time to Expand to Global Markets?,” <em class="emphasis">AllBusiness.com</em>, April 14, 2008, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-managements/company-strategy/8518731-1.html">www.allbusiness.com/company-activities-managements/company-strategy/8518731-1.html</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s02_p02">Shipping costs pose another threat to cash flow. Shipping products overseas is very expensive, with the fees sometimes being as high as the cost of shipping the merchandise itself. Add to that the differences in currencies and taxes, and a business is faced with the possibility of having to pay all or most of the shipping costs up front. While waiting for customers to pay, paying these costs will have a negative impact on cash flow.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_150">Anita Campbell, “How to Make Your Website Ready for International Business,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, October 29, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/10/website-ready-international-business.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/10/website-ready-international-business.html</a>.</span> Fortunately, there are cost-cutting approaches available. For example, Michael Katz, a small business owner who ships portfolio and art cases overseas, was able to reduce the extra expenses by negotiating a discount with UPS, cutting his shipping costs to 50 percent of the list rate.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_151">Elise Craig, “How to Get Your Small Business into the Export Game,” <em class="emphasis">CBS Money Watch</em>, March 3, 2011, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-505143_162-46540438/how-to-get-your-small-business-into-the-export-game">www.cbsnews.com/8301-505143_162-46540438/how-to-get-your-small-business-into-the-export-game</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Implications of Technology and the E-Environment</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p01">Inexpensive technology and the Internet have made it possible for small businesses to operate internationally with some of the same efficiencies as larger companies.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_152">Anita Campbell, “Preparing Your Business to Go Global,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, November 19, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/11/preparing-your-business-to-go-global.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/11/preparing-your-business-to-go-global.html</a>.</span> The global reach of the Internet makes it cost-effective for small businesses to sell products and services overseas. Small businesses can broaden their presence internationally by adopting e-commerce and e-business practices that are user-friendly for non-English-speaking countries.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_153">US Department of Commerce, <em class="emphasis">A Basic Guide to Exporting</em>, 10th ed.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p02">The small business owner can also look to several other sources of assistance for global endeavors. Consider the following three examples:</p>
        <ol class="orderedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_l01">
            <li>The self-service advertising product developed by Facebook gives small businesses an opportunity to reach a global audience.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_154">“Small Business News: The Global View,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, January 18, 2011, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2011/01/small-business-news-the-global-view.html">smallbiztrends.com/2011/01/small-business-news-the -global-view.html</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>Shipping management software packages will automatically figure the costs and the delivery times for overseas orders, giving a close estimate. They also convert the currency for the buyer. Integrating this software into the website of a small business will provide a seamless experience for the customer, making an important contribution to customer value.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_155">Anita Campbell, “How to Make Your Website Ready for International Business,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Trends</em>, October 29, 2010, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://smallbiztrends.com/2010/10/website-ready-international-business.html">smallbiztrends.com/2010/10/website-ready-international-business.html</a>.</span>
</li>
            <li>The Internet and mobile devices lower information and communication costs, providing new channels of distribution and permitting 24/7 global reach through Twitter, wikis, e-mail alerts, and <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.skype.com">Skype</a>.</li>

            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p03">Michael has been very successful with his exporting business. Instead of choosing Canada, Japan, or Mexico, the top three countries for small business exporting, he decided on Babalacala, a small country in the Middle East that has a history of political stability even though it has been ruled by one man for more than thirty-five years. The risk has been worth it so far. Michael identified the demand for his product, and he was right on target with his marketing research.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p04">Michael has a small manufacturing plant that employs 150 locals and 5 people from the United States. He has successfully adapted his product to the local cultural, legal, and economic environments. His prices and promotion strategy are good fits, and his distribution structure—with some minor tweaking—is proving to be very efficient and effective. Needless to say, Michael and his investors are very happy campers.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p05">But not for much longer.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p06">Michael awakened one morning to a large-scale revolt against the current governor of Babalacala. The streets of the capital city were filled with protestors. Things were peaceful at first, but violence erupted in the afternoon. Many of Michael’s local workers left the factory to protest or because they were afraid. Telecommunications were out, transportation was spotty, and there was only intermittent power. Most of the local stores closed. The word on the street was that the protestors were in for the long haul. They planned to keep protesting until the current governor resigned or left the country.</p>
            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch15_s04_s03_p07">What should Michael do? He has a lot of money, time, and passion invested in his exporting business, and there are investors to think about. He does not want to leave Babalacala, but this is a serious situation.</p>
