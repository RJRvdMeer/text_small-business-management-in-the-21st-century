Behaving ethically should happen because it is the right thing to do. However, companies large and small are in the business of making money, so the question is not an unreasonable one.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_s02_p01">By contrast, the costs of unethical business behavior can be staggering. Some of the costs include the loss of physical assets, increased security, the loss of customers, the loss of employees, the loss of reputation, legal costs, the loss of investor confidence, regulatory intrusion, and the costs of bankruptcy. According to a report by the Josephson Institute,<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_096">“The Hidden Costs of Unethical Behavior,” <em class="emphasis">Josephson Institute</em>, 2004, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://josephsoninstitute.org/pdf/Report_HiddenCostsUnethicalBehavior.pdf">josephsoninstitute.org/pdf/Report_HiddenCostsUnethicalBehavior.pdf</a>.</span> unethical business behavior has an adverse impact on sales, stock prices, productivity, the performance of the highly skilled employees, efficiency, communication, and employee retention and recruiting plus the risks from scandal and employee fraud.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s03_s02_p02">The costs of employee theft are particularly daunting. An estimated 75 percent of employees steal from the workplace, and most do so repeatedly. One third of all US corporate bankruptcies are caused directly by employee theft; US companies lose nearly $400 billion per year in lost productivity due to “time theft” or loafing; and an estimated 20 percent of every dollar earned by a US company is lost to employee theft.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_097">Terrence Shulman, “Employee Theft Statistics,” <em class="emphasis">Employee Theft Solutions</em>, 2007, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.employeetheftsolutions.com">www.employeetheftsolutions.com</a>.</span> Office supplies, money, and merchandise are the most frequently stolen items.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_098">Leslie Taylor, “Four in 10 Managers Have Fired Employees for Theft,” <em class="emphasis">Inc.</em>, September 1, 2006, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.inc.com/news/articles/200609/theft.html?partner=rss">www.inc.com/news/articles/200609/theft.html?partner=rss</a>.</span> Employee theft may be even more of a concern to small businesses because many small businesses operate so close to the margin.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p01">In business, it is common for there to be conflicts between business success and ethical behavior. When faced with an ethical dilemma, the decision may be unduly influenced by profits and legality. This challenge is particularly acute for small business owners because they are so much closer to the employees and the customers. The results of ethical decisions will be felt more immediately by the entire company.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_100">Karen E. Klein, “Making the Case for Business Ethics,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, April 26, 2010, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/content/dec2008/sb20081230_999118.htm">www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/content/dec2008/sb20081230_999118.htm</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p02">Small-business owners will find themselves confronted more often with ethical choices because of the decision-making autonomy that they have; there is no need to answer to a large number of employees, corporate management, or a corporate board. The ethical choices that are made will likely impact a far greater number of people than will the ethical decisions of individual employees. Many business decisions will pose ethical challenges—examples being whether to use inferior materials to produce products because of competition with larger businesses, employee and workplace problems, product quality and pricing, legal problems, and government regulatory concerns.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_101">Jeffrey S. Hornsby et al., “The Ethical Perceptions of Small Business Owners: A Factor Analytic Study,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Small Business Management</em> 32 (1994): 9–16, adapted.</span> The pressure to make an unethical choice on behalf of the small business can be very powerful, especially when the health and vitality of the business may be at stake.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_102">“Business Ethics,” <em class="emphasis">Answers.com</em>, 2001, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.answers.com/topic/business-ethics">www.answers.com/topic/business-ethics</a>.</span> Fortunately, the chances of an unethical decision being made in a small business are lower because the individual or individuals who are harmed will always be more visible. It is more difficult for the small business owner to be unethical. Ultimately, small business owners will behave in accordance with “their own moral compass, sense of fair play and inclination to deal in good faith.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_103">Jim Blasingame, “Small Business Ethics,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Advocate</em>, August 13, 2001, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessadvocate.com/motivational-minutes/small-business-ethics-22">www.smallbusinessadvocate.com/motivational-minutes/small-business-ethics-22</a>.</span></p>

King, “Small Business Ethics: Influences and Perceptions,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Small Business Management</em> 11, no. 8 (1982): 11–18.</span> small businesses see norms and pressures from the community and peers as having more influence on their ethics than moral or religious principles, the anticipation of rewards, upholding the law, or the fear of punishment. This leads to the conclusion that small business is influenced significantly by the communities in which their businesses are located. Socially responsive behavior is visible and it is “rewarded or sanctioned by local residents through changes in employee morale, performance, and turnover; customer loyalty; and positive interactions with business service professionals, suppliers, local government officials, and business colleagues. These local sanctioning mechanisms [in turn affected] the success of the business.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_105">Terry L. Besser, “Community Involvement and the Perception of Success among Small Business Operators in Small Towns,” <em class="emphasis">Journal of Small Business Management</em> 37, no. 4 (1999): 16–29.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s04_p04">Because of this community influence, customer relationships are and must be based on trust and the relatively immediate visibility of ethical behavior. It is perhaps not surprising that people in small business are ranked number one on ethical standards ahead of physicians, people in big business, and government officials.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_106">Daniel J.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Focus on business practices and specific issues.</strong> The content of one company’s code of ethics will differ from that of another.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tailor it to fit your business.</strong> One size does not fit all. Make sure your code of ethics reflects the values and mission of your company.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Include employees in developing a code of ethics.</strong> A mandate from the small business owner will not be effective. Get input from your employees whenever possible. They will be more accepting of the ethics policy.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Train your people to be ethical.</strong> The extent and nature of employee education and training will depend on the size of the small business. Even the smallest business, however, will benefit from some ethics training.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Post your code of ethics internally and set up a reporting system.</strong> Employees need a way to let someone know about ethics violations. Both an open-door policy and an anonymous reporting system will be helpful.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Consider appointing a compliance person.</strong> This would probably not be appropriate for the very small businesses. However, it would be worth considering if the business has fifty or more employees. Having someone to whom employees can report suspected ethical problems would make things much simpler.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Follow up on any ethics violations you uncover.</strong> Make sure that everyone understands the ramifications of ethics policy violations. Include an appeals process. If a small business owner fails to act on ethics violations, employees will not take the policy seriously.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Live it from the top down.</strong> The small business owner must walk the talk. No one should appear to be above the code of ethics. Good role modeling is critical.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s04_s05_p06">The actual development of a code of ethics can be done by starting from scratch, hiring a consultant, or customizing a code from another organization. Before making a choice, it would be worth doing some research. A good place to start would be <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.conductcode.com">www.conductcode.com</a>, a website that looks at codes of conduct from a practitioner approach. A search of the Internet will provide examples of codes of ethics, but there is a bias toward larger companies, so small business owners will have to pick and choose what will be best suited to their respective companies.</p>

                <li>Ethics are about doing the right thing. They are about standards that help us decide between right and wrong. They are not the same as our feelings, religion, the law, cultural norms, science, or values.</li>
                <li>Ethics are important because they provide structure and stabilization for society.</li>
                <li>Business ethics are about applying the virtues and discipline of ethics to business behavior. They set the standard for how your business is conducted and define the value system of how you operate in the marketplace and within your business.</li>
                <li>Companies that “outbehave” the competition ethically tend to outperform them financially.</li>
                <li>Ethical behavior in business improves the workplace climate and will ultimately improve the bottom line. The cost of unethical behavior can be staggering.</li>
                <li>Small-business owners have the opportunity to set the ethical tone for their companies. Modeling ethical behavior is key. The community and peers heavily influence small business ethics.</li>
                <li>Establishing an ethics policy is critical for creating an ethical work environment. The contents of the policy should be specific to the values, goals, and culture of each company. One size does not fit all.</li>

                <li>MaryAnn’s marketing team just presented a “Less Sugar” ad campaign to the cereal brand manager for three of her brands. The packages shouted “75% LESS SUGAR” in large and colorful type so that it would catch the parent’s eye and increase sales. With all the recent attention about childhood obesity, the company thought that parents would purchase the cereal to help their children attain and keep a healthy weight. A side-by-side comparison of the less-sugar and the high-sugar versions of the cereals, however, revealed that the carbohydrate content of the cereals was essentially the same. At best, the less-sugar version had only ten fewer calories per bowl. It offered no weight-loss advantage. The brand manager correctly concluded that the marketing campaign was unethical.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_114">J. Brooke Hamilton III, “Case Example 1: ‘Less Sugar’ Marketing,” <em class="emphasis">Operationalizing Ethics in Business Settings</em>, 2009, accessed June 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://ethicsops.com/LessSugarMarketingCase.php">ethicsops.com/LessSugarMarketingCase.php</a>.</span> Was the campaign illegal?

                <li>An office supplies business with fifty employees has been doing well, but lately there have been suspicions by some of the employees. No names are known, but it is known that merchandise has been disappearing without explanation, and expensive gifts have been accepted from some vendors. The owner thinks it is time to create and implement a code of ethics. She has asked you for advice. You told her that it would be important to involve the employees in the development of the code, but you committed to do two things for her in preparation for that involvement: (1) search the Internet for a code of ethics that could be tailored to her needs and (2) prepare a preliminary list of topics that should be included in the code. She thanked you and asked that you submit your ideas within the week. She reminded you that her business is small, so a code of ethics for a large corporation would not be suitable.</li>
