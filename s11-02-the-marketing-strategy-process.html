    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_p01">The focus of this text is on the management of the small business that is up and running as opposed to a start-up operation. As a result, the considerations of marketing strategy are twofold: (1) to modify or tweak marketing efforts already in place and (2) to add products or services as the business evolves. In some instances, it may be appropriate and desirable for a small business to backfit its marketing activities into a complete marketing strategy framework.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_p02">The marketing strategy process consists of several components (<a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_f01">Figure 7.1 "Marketing Strategy Process"</a>). Each component should be considered and designed carefully: company vision, company mission, marketing objectives, and the marketing strategy itself.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_s01_p03">Both the vision statement and the mission statement must be developed carefully because they “provide direction for a new or small firm, without which it is difficult to develop a cohesive plan.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_p01"><strong class="emphasis bold">Marketing objectives</strong> are what a company wants to accomplish with its marketing. They lay the groundwork for formulating the marketing strategy. Although formulated in a variety of ways, their achievement should lead to sales. The creation of marketing objectives is one of the most critical steps a business will take. The company needs to know, as precisely as possible, what it wants to achieve before allocating any resources to the marketing effort.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_s02_p02">Marketing objectives should be SMART: specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based (i.e., have a stated time frame for achievement). It has been recommended that small businesses limit the number of objectives to a maximum of three or four. If you have fewer than two objectives, you aren’t growing your business like you should be in order to keep up with the market. Having more than four objectives will divide your attention, and this may result in a lackluster showing on each objective and no big successes.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_013">“How to Choose Marketing Plan Objectives,” accessed January 24, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.hellomarketing.biz/planning-strategy/marketing-plan-objectives.php">www.hellomarketing.biz/planning-strategy/marketing-plan-objectives.php</a>.</span> If a small business has multiple marketing objectives, they will have to be evaluated to ensure that they do not conflict with each other. The company should also determine if it has the resources necessary to accomplish all its objectives.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_014">Adapted from “Marketing Plan: Marketing Objectives and Strategies,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Notes</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusinessnotes.com/starting-a-business/marketing-plan-marketing-objectives-and-strategies.html">www.smallbusinessnotes.com/starting -a-business/marketing-plan-marketing-objectives-and-strategies.html</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">The Marketing Strategy</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch07_s02_s03_p01">With its focus being on achieving the marketing objectives, marketing strategy involves segmenting the market and selecting a target or targets, making differentiation and positioning decisions, and designing the marketing mix. The design of the product (one of the four Ps) will include design of the company website. Differentiation refers to a company’s efforts to set its product or service apart from the competition, and positioning is placing the brand (whether store, product, or service) in the consumer’s mind in relation to other competing products based on product traits and benefits that are relevant to the consumer.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_018">Dana-Nicoleta Lascu and Kenneth E.

It has been said that “in some cases strategy just happens because a market and a product find each other and grow organically. However, small businesses that understand the power of an overarching marketing strategy, filtered and infused in every tactical process, will usually enjoy greater success.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn07_019">John Jantsch, “The Cycle of Strategy,” <em class="emphasis">Duct Tape Marketing</em>, March 29, 2010, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2010/03/29/the-cycle-of-strategy">www.ducttapemarketing.com/blog/2010/03/29/the-cycle-of -strategy</a>.</span></p>
