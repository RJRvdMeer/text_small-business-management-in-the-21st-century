            <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p06">Prediction is very difficult, especially about the future.</p>
            <p class="attribution">Nils Bohr, Nobel Prize winner</p>
        </div>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p01">Any business plan is a future-oriented document. Business plans are required to look between three and five years into the future. To produce them and accurately forecast sales, you will need estimates of expenses and other items, such as the required number of employees, interest rates, and general economic conditions. There are many different techniques and tools that can be used to forecast these items. The type of techniques used will be influenced by many factors, such as the following:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_l01">
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The size of the business.</strong> Smaller businesses may have fewer resources to apply a wide variety of forecasting techniques.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The analytical sophistication of people who will be conducting the forecast.</strong> The owner of a home business may have no prior experience with forecasting techniques.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The type of the organization.</strong> A manufacturing concern that sells to a stable and relatively predictable environment that has been in existence for years might be able to employ a variety of standard statistical forecasting techniques; however, a small firm operating in a new or a chaotic environment might have to rely on significantly different techniques.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Historical records.</strong> Does the firm have historical records for sales that can be used to project into the future?</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p02">There is no universal set of forecasting techniques that can be used for all types of small and midsize businesses. Forecasting can fall into a fairly comprehensive range of techniques with respect to level of sophistication. Some forecasting can be done on an intuitive basis (e.g., back-of-the-envelope calculations); others can be done with standard computer programs (e.g., Excel) or programs that are specifically dedicated to forecasting in a variety of environments.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p03">A brief review of basic forecasting techniques shows that they can be divided into two broad classes: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">qualitative forecasting methods</a><span class="glossdef">Methods that assume that one does not have historical data or cannot rely on past historical data.</span></span> and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">quantitative forecasting methods</a><span class="glossdef">Methods that consist of techniques that assume you can use past data to make projections of the future.</span></span>. Actually, these terms can be somewhat misleading because qualitative forecasting methods do not imply that no numbers will be involved. The two techniques are separated by the following concept: qualitative forecasting methods assume that one either does not have historical data or that one cannot rely on past historical data. A start-up business has no past sales that can be used to project future sales. Likewise, if there is a significant change in the environment, one may feel uncomfortable using past data to project into the future. A restaurant operates in a small town that contains a large automobile factory. After the factory closes, the restaurant owner should anticipate that past sales will no longer be a useful guideline for projecting what sales might be in the next year or two because the owner has lost a number of customers who worked at the factory. Quantitative forecasting, on the other hand, consists of techniques and methods that assume you can use past data to make projections into the future.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s02_p05">Forecasting key items such as sales is crucial in developing a good business plan. However, forecasting is a very challenging activity. The further out the forecast, the less likely it will be accurate. Everyone recognizes this fact. Therefore, it is useful to draw on a variety of forecasting techniques to develop your final forecast for the business plan. To do that, you should have a fairly solid understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the various approaches. There are many books, websites, and articles that could assist you in understanding these techniques and when they should or should not be used. In addition, one should be open to gathering additional information to assist in building a forecast. Some possible sources of such information would be associations, trade publications, and business groups. Regardless of what technique is used or the data source employed in building a forecast for business plan, one should be prepared to justify why you are employing these forecasting models.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p01">Building your first business plan may seem extremely formidable. This may explain why there are so many software packages available to assist in this task. After building your first business plan, that steep learning curve should make subsequent plans for the business or other businesses significantly easier.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p02">In preparing to build a business plan, there are some problem areas or mistakes that you should be on guard to avoid. Some may be technical in nature, while others relate to content issues. For the technical side, first and foremost, one should make sure that there are no misspellings or punctuation errors. The business plan should follow a logical structure. No ideal business plan clearly specifies the exact sections that need to be included nor is there an ideal length. Literature concerning business plans indicates that the appropriate length of the body of a business plan line should be between twenty and forty pages. This does not include appendixes that might provide critical data for the reader.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p03">In developing a lengthy report, sometimes it is easy to fall into clichés or overused expressions. These should be avoided. Consider the visuals in the report. Data should be placed in either clearly mapped-out tables or well-designed graphs. The report should be as professional looking as possible. Anticipate the audience that will be reading the report and write in a way that easily reaches them; avoid using too much jargon or technical terms.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_p04">The content in any business plan centers on two areas: realism and accuracy.</p>

Quite often, it is the first section that a reader will turn to, and sometimes it may be the only section of the business plan that he or she will read.

Your goals might focus on your human resource policies (“We wish to have productive, happy employees”), on what you see as the source of your competitive advantage (“We will be best in service”), or on financial outcomes (“We will produce above average return to our investors.”) Goals are useful, but they can mean anything to anyone. It is therefore necessary to translate the goals into objectives to bring about real meaning so that they can guide the organization. Ideally, objectives should be <strong class="emphasis bold">SMART</strong>—specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and have a specific timeline for completion. Here is an example: one organizational goal may be a significant rise in sales and profits. When translating that goal into an objective, you might word the objectives as follows: a 15 percent increase in sales for the next three years followed by a 10 percent increase in sales for the following two years and a 12.5 percent increase in profits in each of the next five years. These objectives are quite specific and measurable. It is up to the decision maker to determine if they are achievable and realistic. These objectives—sales and profits—clearly specify the time horizon. In developing the plan, owners are often very happy to develop goals because they are open to interpretation, but they will avoid objectives. Goals are sufficiently ambiguous, whereas objectives tie you to particular values that you will have to hit in the future. People may be concerned that they will be weighed on a scale and found wanting for failing to achieved their objectives. However, it is critical that your plan contains both goals and objectives. Objectives allow investors and your employees to clearly see where the firm intends to go. They produce targeted values to aim for and, therefore, are critical for the control of the firm’s operations.</p>

                <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s03_l01">
                    <li>Who are we? What business are we in?</li>
                    <li>Who do we see as our customers?</li>
                    <li>How do we provide value for those customers?</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s03_p03">Sometimes vision and mission statements are singularly written for external audiences, such as investors or shareholders. They are not written for the audience for whom it would have the greatest meaning—the management team and the employees of the business. Unfortunately, many recognize that both statements can become exercises of stringing together a series of essentially meaningless phrases into something that appears to sound <em class="emphasis">right</em> or <em class="emphasis">professional</em>. You can find software on the web to automatically generate such vacuous and meaningless statements.</p>

This section identifies those specific elements of your firm that you believe will ensure success. It is important for you to be able to define the competencies that you intend to leverage to ensure success. What makes your product or service unique? What specific set of capabilities do you bring to the competitive scene? These might include the makeup of and the experience of your management team; your operational capabilities (e.g., unique skills in design, manufacturing, or delivery); your marketing skill sets: your financial capabilities (e.g., the ability to control costs); or the personnel that make up the company.</p>

A thorough understanding of the industry that you will be operating in is essential to understand the possible returns that your company will earn within that industry. Investors want to know if they will recover their initial investment. When will they see a profit? Remember, investors often carefully track industries and are well aware of the strengths and limitations within a particular industry. Investors are looking for industries that can demonstrate growth. They also want to see if the industry is structurally attractive. This might entail conducting Porter’s five forces analysis; however, this is not required in all cases. If there appear to be some issues or problems with industry level growth, then you might want to be able to identify some segments of the industry where growth is viable.</p>

                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s05_p01">This section should be an in-depth discussion of what you are offering to customers. It should provide a complete and clear statement of the products or the services that you are offering. It should also discuss the core competencies of your business. You should highlight what is unique, such as a novel product or service concept or the possession of patents. You need to show how your product or service specifically meets particular market needs. You must identify how the product or the service will satisfy specific customers’ needs. If you are dealing with a new product or service, you need to demonstrate what previously unidentified needs it will meet and how it will do so. At its birth, Amazon had to demonstrate that an online bookstore would be preferable to the standard bookstore by offering the customer a much wider selection of books than would be available at an on-site location.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s05_p02">This section could include a discussion of technical issues. If the business is based on a technological innovation—such as a new type of software or an invention—then it is necessary to provide an adequate discussion of the specific nature of the technology. One should take care to always remember the audience for whom you are writing the plan. Do not make this portion too technical in nature. This section also might discuss the future direction of the product or service—namely, where will you be taking (changing) the product or the service after the end of the current planning horizon? This may require a discussion of future investment requirements or the required time to develop new products and services. This section may also include a discussion of pricing the product or the service, although a more detailed discussion of the issue of pricing might be found in the marketing plan section. If you plan to include the issue of pricing here, you should discuss how the pricing of the product or the service was determined. The more detailed you are in this description, the more realistic it will appear to the readers of the business plan. You may wish to discuss relationships that you have with vendors that might have an impact on reducing cost and therefore an impact on price. It is important to discuss how your pricing scheme will compare with competitors. Will it be higher than average or below the average price? How does the pricing fit in with the overall strategy of the firm?</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s05_p03">This section must have a high degree of honesty. Investors will know much about the industry and its limitations. You need to identify any areas that might be possible sources of problems, such as government regulations, issues with new product development, securing distribution channels, and informing the market of your existence. Further, it is important to identify the current competitors in the industry and possible future competitors.</p>

The marketing section of the business plan might provide more in-depth coverage of how the product or the service better meets customer value than that of competitors. It should identify your target customers and include coverage of who your competitors are and what they provide. The comparison between your firm and its competitors should highlight differences and point to why you are providing superior value. Pricing issues, if not covered in the previous section, could be discussed or discussed in more detail.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s06_p02">The issue of location, particularly in retail, should be covered in detail. Perhaps one of the most important elements of the marketing plan section is to specify how you intend to attract customers, inform them of the benefits of using your product or service, and retain customers. Initially, customers are attracted through advertising. This section should delineate the advertising plan. What media will be used—flyers, newspapers, magazines, radio, television, web presence, direct marketing, and/or social media campaigns? This section should cover any promotional campaigns that might be used.</p>

Readers of your business plan and potential investors should have a clear sense of the management team that will be running a business. They should know the team with respect to the team’s knowledge of the business, their experience and capabilities, and their drive to succeed.

It should contain an organizational chart that will delineate the responsibilities and the chain of command for the business. It should specify who will occupy each major position of the business. You might want to explain who is doing what job and why. For every member of the management team, you should have a complete résumé. This should include educational background (both formal and informal) and past work experience, including the jobs they have held, responsibilities, and accomplishments. You might want to include some other biographical data such as age, although that is not required.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s07_p03">If you plan to use specific advisers or consultants, you should mention the names and backgrounds of these people in this section of the plan. You should also specify why these people are being used.</p>

You should specify the intended salaries for the management team while also including issues of their benefits and bonuses or any stock position that they may take in the company. This section should also identify any gaps in the management team and how you intend to fill these positions.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s07_p05">Depending on the nature of the business, you might wish to include in this section the personnel (employees) that will be required.

Before proceeding with these sections, we discuss the assumptions used to build these sections. The opening section of the financial statements section should also include, in summary format, projections of sales, the sales growth rate, key expenses and their growth rates, net income across the forecasting horizon, and assets and liabilities.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_032">Amir M Hormozi, Gail S.

It is vital that this section—whether you are an existing business seeking more funding or a start-up—have realistic financial projections. The business plan should contain clear statements of the underlying assumptions that were used to make these financial projections. The clearer the statements and the more realistic the assumptions behind these statements, then the greater the confidence the reader will have in these projections. Few businesspeople have a thorough understanding of these financial statements; therefore, it is advisable that someone with an accounting or a financial background review these statements before they are included in the report. We will have a much more in-depth discussion of these statements in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch09#cadden_1.0-ch09">Chapter 9 "Accounting and Cash Flow"</a>.</p>
                <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s03_s01_s08_p03">The future planning horizon for financial projections is normally between three and five years. The duration that you will use will depend on the amount of capital that the business is seeking to raise, the type of industry the business is in, and the forecasting issues associated with making projections. Also, the detail required in these financial statements will be directly tied to the type and size of the business.</p>

From the standpoint of the potential investor, it is always better to err on the side of conservatism. Regardless of either bias, business plans are generally built on the basis of expected futures and past experience. Unfortunately, the future does not always emerge in a clearly predicated manner. One can have a dramatic change that can have significant impact on the business. Often such changes occur in the external environment and are beyond the control of the business management team. These external changes can occur within the technical environment; it can be based on changes in customer needs, changes with respect to the suppliers, changes in the economic environment—at the local, national, or global level. Dramatic change can also occur within the organization itself—the death of the owner or members of the management team.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_033">“Workshops and Events,” <em class="emphasis">SCORE</em>, accessed October 10, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.score.org/events/workshops">www.score.org/events/workshops</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p03">One way for an organization to deal with significant changes is a process known as <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">scenario planning</a><span class="glossdef">A process that examines the impact and possible responses to events that may be unlikely but that would have significant impact on a business.</span></span>. The real origins of scenario planning can be traced back to the early nineteenth century activity known as Kreigsspiel—war gaming—a system for training officers developed by the Prussian command. This process of looking at future wars was adopted by many militaries in the later nineteenth century. In the 1950s, a more formal format was used at the RAND Institute for examining possible future changes in the military and geopolitical environments. The early 1980s saw it applied to industrial settings. Royal Dutch Shell examined the question of what would happen if there were a significant drop in the price of oil. This was after two oil crises that pushed the price of oil up significantly. The notion that oil prices would drop was considered to be an extremely unlikely event, but it did occur. Royal Dutch Shell was one of the few oil companies that did not suffer because its scenario analyses enabled them to be ready to deal with that situation.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_034">P.

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_p04">What could be the possible use of scenario planning for small businesses? There are several areas in which small businesses should apply scenario planning to be better prepared for future disruptions.</p>
        <div class="section" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01">
            <h2 class="title editable block">Identify Significant Changes That Might Impact the Business</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p01"><em class="emphasis">Consider major shifts in the customer’s notion of value.</em> As mentioned in <a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch02#cadden_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Your Business Idea: The Quest for Value"</a>, the firm should always be examining what constitutes value in the eyes of the consumer and how that might shift. Henry Ford’s model T car was a global success because customers initially valued a reliable vehicle at a low price. Ford Motor Company continued to meet the customer’s notion of value by constantly driving down the unit cost. However, by the mid-1920s, customers’ notion of value included not only price but also issues such as styling and improved technologies. General Motors was able to recognize that there were changes in the customer’s  value notion and provided them with a range of vehicles. Ford failed to recognize that change and suffered a significant drop in sales.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p02"><em class="emphasis">Shifts in the economic environment.</em> The recent recession clearly indicates that economies can suffer significant shifts in a short period of time. These shifts can have dramatic impact on all business operations. Small-business owners have seen significant tightening of bank credit and changes with respect to the requirements for using credit cards. One could easily imagine the critical importance for small businesses to consider the impacts that would follow significant changes in interest rates. Southwest Airlines, in anticipation of possible fluctuations in oil prices, used futures contracts to deal with dramatic shifts in the price of oil. When oil prices rose significantly, they were in a much better position than their competitors.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s01_p03"><em class="emphasis">The entrance of new competitors.</em> Small businesses should always be ready to consider the impact of facing new competitors and new types of competition. Consider the case of small local retail outlets when a Walmart superstore opens in the area.</p>

            <h2 class="title editable block">Consideration of Disasters</h2>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s02_p01">The best way to deal with any potential disaster is not while it is occurring or after it has happened but before it occurs. Small businesses should anticipate what they will do in the case of physical disasters, such as fire, earthquakes, or floods. Other disasters might involve the bankruptcy or loss of a major supplier or a major customer. A restaurant or a food market should have a contingency plan in the case of a power failure that might lead to food spoilage. Such a business might also want to conduct a scenario planning exercise to see what its responses would be in the case of a customer complaining of food poisoning. Other disaster scenarios that should be considered by small businesses include the impact and ramifications of having the computer system crash; having the service for the website crash; or having the website hacked, with the possible loss of customer information.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s03_p01">Almost all businesses, large and small, must be prepared to seize new opportunities. This may mean that they have to consider the impact of technological change on the business or how technology can offer them new business opportunities. The technology of stereo lithography, a process by which three-dimensional objects are built layer by layer, has been available for more than a decade. Bespoke Innovations saw the potential for using this technology. Bespoke Innovations can develop, in a short period of time, custom artificial legs for a price of $5,000–$6,000 and with features that are not found in $60,000 prostheses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn05_035">Ashlee Vance, “A Technology Sets Inventors Free to Dream,” <em class="emphasis">New York Times</em>, September 14, 2010.</span></p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s03_p02">Scenario planning should be a periodic exercise, but it should be conducted no more than once a year. The actual frequency might be dependent on the perceived rate of change for the industry or the presence of storm clouds on the horizon. Scenario planning has several distinct activities, which may be as follows:</p>
            <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s03_l01">
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Pick one area that might occur in the future that would have significant impact on the business.</strong> What if the national joblessness rate remains at over 9 percent for the next three to five years? What if a major customer decides to buy from a competitor or that customer is in financial trouble? What if there are changes in the national defense budget? A luncheonette in New London, Connecticut, where Electric Boat builds nuclear submarines, wants to consider the impact of changes in the defense budget. A decrease in the budget for building nuclear submarines would reduce the number of subs made in New London, which might lead to layoffs at Electric Boat and fewer customers for the luncheonette.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Identify factors that might impact that issue.</strong> This sometimes is referred to as a PEST analysis, where the P stands for political issues, E stands for economic issues, S stands for sociocultural issues, and T stands for technology issues. Each factor would be analyzed to see how it might impact the scenario. In our previous luncheonette example, the restaurant might want to consider an upcoming election to see how each party would support defense appropriations, and it might look at the overall economy to determine whether a downturn in the economy might lead to a cut in defense appropriations. It is unlikely that sociocultural issues would impact defense appropriations. Technology issues, whether a breakthrough in some design by the United States or by some other country, might determine the number and location of submarines built in the United States.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Rank the relative importance of the previous factors.</strong> Not all factors under consideration can be considered equally important. It is critical in a scenario planning exercise to see which factors are most important so that decision makers can focus on the ramifications of those factors in the analysis.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Develop scenarios.</strong> Having identified the relative importance of the factors, the next stage would be to develop a limited number of possible scenarios (no more than two or three). Each scenario would map out possible outcomes for each key factor. Based on these values, the group conducting the scenario planning exercise would develop insights into this possible future world.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">How do the scenarios impact your business?</strong> For each future scenario, the team should examine how that possible future state would impact the operation of the business. Continuing with the luncheonette example, the owner might see that a particular political party would be elected in the next election and the economy will still be in the doldrums. Together, this might indicate a cut in the naval building budget. This will translate into a reduced number of submarines built in New London and a reduction in employment at Electric Boat. The luncheonette’s sales will obviously drop off. Now the owner must consider what it might do in that situation.</li>
            </ul>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s04_s03_p03">Scenario planning offers the opportunity for small business owners to examine the future on a long-term basis. It should force them to look at external environments and conditions that can have a dramatic impact on the survival of their firm. It broadens their thinking and creates an environment of increased flexibility. It enables a business to respond to those sudden shocks that might destroy other firms.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s05_p01">Business plans can be built using a combination of word-processing and spreadsheet programs by those who are adept at using them. However, the entire process of constructing a comprehensive business plan can be greatly simplified by using a dedicated business plan software package. These packages are designed to produce reports that have all the required sections for a business plan, they greatly facilitate the creation of the financial statements with charts, and they often allow for the inclusion of materials from other programs. Most of them are fairly reasonably priced from $50 to $150.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s05_p02">There are many such packages on the market, and they range from those designed for novices to those that can generate annual plans by easily incorporating data from external sources, such as the accounting programs of a business.

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ease of building the report.</strong> The various sections of the report should be clearly identified, and the authors should be able to work on each section independent of their sequence within the report. Text and data entry should be simple and allow for easy corrections or revisions.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Financial statements.</strong> The software should facilitate building the income statement, the balance sheet, and the cash-flow statement. For multiyear projections, the software should support the forecasting process.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Import from other programs.</strong> The software should be able to incorporate data from a variety of programs, such as Word and Excel. Ideally, it should be able to import data from a variety of accounting programs.</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Support services.</strong> The software company should bundle a variety of support services, including clear instructions, tutorials, and access to Internet or call-number support. Many packages provide sample business plans for different industries.</li>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch05_s03_s05_p03">The secondary factors are as follows:</p>

                <li>The business planning for a start-up business should consider if the owner(s) is/are ready to accept the challenges of operating a business.</li>
                <li>Comprehensive business plans will require information about the industry, competitors, and customers. Owners or the writers of the business plan should be aware of where they can obtain this information.</li>
                <li>Forecasting is critical to the success of any business. There are many different approaches to forecasting: some are simple extrapolations of trends, while others can be computationally complex. The business should use a forecasting system that is not only accurate but also makes the users feel comfortable.</li>
                <li>Although business plans come in different “sizes and shapes,” they should have some key sections: executive summary, mission statement, industry analysis, marketing plan, description of the management team, and financial projections.</li>
                <li>Some businesses should make it a practice of conducting scenario analyses. This is a process of examining possible future events and what should be the response of the business.</li>
                <li>The complexity and difficulty of building a comprehensive business plan can be significantly reduced by using one of the available business-planning software packages.</li>
