    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_p01">It is very important in marketing to distinguish between the customer and the consumer. The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">customer</a><span class="glossdef">The person or the business that actually buys a product or a service.</span></span>, the person or the business that actually buys a product or a service, will determine whether a business succeeds or fails. It is that simple. It does not matter one iota if a business thinks its product or service is the greatest thing since sliced bread if no one wants to buy it. This is why customers play such a central role in marketing, with everything revolving around their needs, wants, and desires. We see the customer focus in the marketing concept, and we see it in the marketing mix.</p>

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_p02">The marketing mix should follow the determination of customer needs, wants, and desires. However, there are instances in which a product is created before the target market is selected and before the rest of the marketing mix is designed. One well-known example is Ivory Soap. This product was created by accident. Air was allowed to work its way into the white soap mixture that was being cooked. The result was Ivory Soap, a new and extraordinarily successful product for Procter &amp; Gamble.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_017">“History of Ivory Soap,” <em class="emphasis">Essortment.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.essortment.com/history-ivory-soap-21051.html">www.essortment.com/history-ivory-soap-21051.html</a>.</span> Most companies do not have this kind of luck, though, so a more deliberate approach to understanding the customer is critical to designing the right marketing mix.</p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_p03">The <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">consumer</a><span class="glossdef">The person or the company that uses or consumes a product.</span></span> is the person or the company that uses or consumes a product. For example, the customer of a dry cleaning service is the person who drops off clothes, picks them up, and pays for the service. The consumer is the person who wears the clothes. Another example is a food service that caters business events. The person who orders lunch on behalf of the company is the customer. The people who eat the lunch are the consumers. The person who selects the catering service could be either or both. It is common for the customer and the consumer to be the same person, but this should not be assumed for all instances. The challenge is deciding whether to market to the customer or the consumer—or perhaps both.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Customer Markets</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p01">There are two major types of customer markets: <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">business-to-business (B2B)</a><span class="glossdef">Organizations such as corporations; small businesses; government agencies; wholesalers; retailers; and nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals, universities, and museums.</span></span> customers and <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">individual consumers or end users (business-to-consumer [B2C])</a><span class="glossdef">People who buy for themselves, their households, friends, coworkers, or for other non-business-related purposes.</span></span>. B2B customers are organizations such as corporations; small businesses; government agencies; wholesalers; retailers; and nonprofit organizations, such as hospitals, universities, and museums. In terms of dollar volume, the B2B market is where the action is. More dollars and products change hands in sales to business buyers than to individual consumers or end users.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn06_018">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 182.</span> The B2B market offers many opportunities for the small business. Examples of B2B products include office supplies and furniture, machinery, ingredients for food preparation, telephone and cell phone service, and delivery services such as FedEx or UPS.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_s01_p02">The B2C market consists of people who buy for themselves, their households, friends, coworkers, or other non-business-related purposes. Examples of B2C products include cars, houses, clothing, food, telephone and cell phone service, cable television service, and medical services. Opportunities in this market are plentiful for small businesses. A walk down Main Street and a visit to the Internet are testaments to this fact.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Understanding the Customer</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch06_s02_s02_p01">The better a small business understands its customers, the better off it will be. It is not easy, and it takes time, but knowing who the customers are, where they come from, what they like and dislike, and what makes them tick will be of immeasurable value in designing a successful marketing mix. Being intuitive can and does work…but not for everyone and not all the time. A more systematic and thorough approach to understanding the customer makes much more sense. The problem is that many if not most small businesses probably do not take the time to do what it takes to understand their customers. This is an important part of the reason why so many small businesses fail.</p>

Loyalty is about making a customer feel special. This is the dream of all small businesses—which is something that small businesses are particularly well suited to create. Because of their size, it is easier for small businesses to have closer relationships with their customers, create a more personal shopping environment, and, in general, create great customer experiences. Think back to Bob Brown of the Cheshire Package Store (<a class="xref" href="cadden_1.0-ch02#cadden_1.0-ch02">Chapter 2 "Your Business Idea: The Quest for Value"</a>). He prides himself on the kind of shopping environment and customer relationships that lead to loyalty.</p>
