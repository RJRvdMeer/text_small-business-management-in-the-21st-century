    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_p01">It’s an exciting time to be in small business. This is certainly not anything new, but you might not know it. Scan any issue of the popular business press, and in all probability, you will find a cover story on one of America’s or the world’s major corporations or a spotlight on their CEOs. Newspapers, talk radio, and television seem to have an unlimited supply of pundits and politicians eager to pontificate on firms that have been labeled as “too big to fail.” Listen to any broadcast of a weekday’s evening news program, and there will be a segment that highlights the ups and downs of the Dow Jones Industrial Average and the Standard and Poor’s (S&amp;P) 500. These market measures provide an insight into what is going on in Wall Street. However, they are clearly biased to not only large firms but also huge firms. This creates the false notion that “real” business is only about big business. It fails to recognize that small businesses are the overwhelming majority of all businesses in America; not only are the majority of jobs in small businesses, but small businesses have also been the major driving force in new job creation and innovation. Small business is <em class="emphasis">the</em> dynamo of innovation in our economy. In 2006, Thomas M. Sullivan, the chief counsel for advocacy of the Small Business Administration (SBA), said, “Small business is a major part of our economy,…small businesses innovate and create new jobs at a faster rate than their larger competitors. They are nimble, creative, and a vital part of every community across the country.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_001">“Small Business by the Numbers,” <em class="emphasis">National Small Business Administration</em>, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.nsba.biz/docs/bythenumbers.pdf">www.nsba.biz/docs/bythenumbers.pdf</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_p02">This text is devoted to small business, not entrepreneurship. There has always been a challenge to distinguish—correctly—between the small business owner and the entrepreneur. Some argue that there is no difference between the two terms. The word <em class="emphasis">entrepreneur</em> is derived from a French word for “to undertake,” which might indicate that entrepreneurs should be identified as those who start businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_002">“A Definition of Entrepreneurship,” <em class="emphasis">QuickMBA.com</em>, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quickmba.com/entre/definition">www.quickmba.com/entre/definition</a>.</span> However, this interpretation is too broad and is pointless as a means of distinguishing between the two. Some have tried to find differences based on background, education, or age.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_003">Nick Leiber, “The Anatomy of an Entrepreneur,” <em class="emphasis">Bloomberg BusinessWeek</em>, July 8, 2009, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/running_small_business/archives/2009/07/anatomy_of_an_e.html">www.BusinessWeek.com/smallbiz/running_small _business/archives/2009/07/anatomy_of_an_e.html</a>.</span> Often one finds the argument that entrepreneurs have a different orientation toward risk than small business owners. The standard line is that entrepreneurs are willing to take great risks in starting an enterprise and/or willing to start again after a business failure.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_004">“Entrepreneur vs. Small Business Owner: What’s the Difference?,” <em class="emphasis">Mills Communication Group</em>, July 22, 2009, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.millscommgroup.com/blog/2009/06/entrepreneur-vs-small-business-owner-whats-the-difference">www.millscommgroup.com/blog/2009/06/entrepreneur-vs-small-business-owner-whats-the-difference</a>.</span> Others try to make the distinction based on the issue of innovation or the degree of innovation. Given this focus, entrepreneurs need not even work for small business because they can come up with innovative products, services, production, or marketing processes in large organizations.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_005">Dale Beermann, “Entrepreneur or Small Business Owner?

    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_p03">This chapter gives a brief history of small business in the United States, the critical importance of small business to the American economy, the challenges facing small business owners as they struggle to survive and prosper, the requisite skills to be an effective small business owner, the critical importance of ethical behavior, and how these businesses may evolve over time. In addition, three critical success factors for the twenty-first-century small business are threaded through the text: (1) <em class="emphasis">identifying and providing customer value</em>, (2) <em class="emphasis">being able to exploit digital technologies with an emphasis on e-business and e-commerce</em>, and (3) <em class="emphasis">properly managing your cash flow</em>. These three threads are essential to the successful decision making of any contemporary small business and should be considered of paramount importance. They are everyday considerations.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">A Brief History of Small Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p01">Throughout American history, from colonial times until today, most businesses were small businesses, and they have played a vital role in America’s economic success and are a forge to our national identity. It would not be an exaggeration to say that the small businessperson has always held an important—even exalted—position in American life. Americans in the early republic were as suspicious of large economic enterprises as threats to their liberty as they were of large government. The historian James L. Houston discussed American suspicion of large economic enterprises: “Americans believed that if property was concentrated in the hands of a few in the republic, those few would use their wealth to control other citizens, seize political power, and warp the republic into an oligopoly.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_006">Jack Beatty, <em class="emphasis">The Age of Betrayal: The Triumph of Money in America 1865–1900</em> (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 2007), 11.</span> In fact, much of the impetus behind the Boston Tea Party was the fear on the part of local merchants and tradesmen that the East India Company, at that time the world’s largest corporation, was dumping low-priced tea in the colonies, which would have driven local business to ruin.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_007">Ted Nace, <em class="emphasis">The Gangs of America: The Rise of Corporate Power and the Disabling of Democracy</em> (San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2003), 44.</span> Jefferson’s promotion of the yeoman farmer, which included small merchants, as the bulwark of democracy stemmed from his fear of large moneyed interests: “The end of democracy and the defeat of the American Revolution will occur when government falls into the hands of lending institutions and moneyed incorporations.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_008">Bob Higgins, “Like Lincoln, Jefferson, Madison—Americans Fear Corporate Control of Public Policy,” <em class="emphasis">TPMCafe</em>, February 17, 2011, accessed October 23, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/r/l/rlh974/2010/02/like-lincoln-jefferson-madison.php">tpmcafe.talkingpointsmemo.com/talk/blogs/r/l/rlh974/2010/02/like-lincoln-jefferson -madison.php</a>.</span> So great was the fear of the large aggregation of wealth that the colonies and the early republic placed severe restrictions on the creation of corporate forms. In the first decades of the nineteenth century, state governments restricted the corporate form by limiting its duration, geographic scope, size, and even profits.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_009">Ted Nace, <em class="emphasis">The Gangs of America: The Rise of Corporate Power and the Disabling of Democracy</em> (San Francisco, Berrett-Koehler Publishers, 2003), 44.</span> This was done because of the concern that corporations had the potential of becoming monopolies that would drive entrepreneurs out of business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p02">Eventually, however, some businesses grew in size and power. Their growth and size necessitated the development of a professional management class that was distinct from entrepreneurs who started and ran their own businesses. However, not until the post–Civil War period did America see the true explosion in big businesses. This was brought about by several factors: the development of the mass market (facilitated by the railroads); increased capital requirement for mass production; and the 1886 Supreme Court case of <em class="emphasis">Santa Clara County v. Southern Pacific Railroad</em>, which granted corporations “personhood” by giving them protection under the Fourteenth Amendment.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p03">The growth of corporations evoked several responses that were designed to protect small businesses from their larger competitors. The Interstate Commerce Act (1887) was a federal law designed to regulate the rates charged by railroads to protect small farmers and businesses. Other federal laws—the Sherman Act (1890) and the Clayton Act (1914)—were passed with the initial intent of restricting the unfair trading practices of trusts. In the early years, however, the Sherman Act was used more frequently against small business alliances and unions than against large businesses. Congress continued to support small businesses through the passage of legislation. The Robinson-Patman Act of 1936 and the Miller-Tydings Act of 1937 were designed to protect small retailers from large chain retailers.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_010">Mansel Blackford, <em class="emphasis">The History of Small Business in America</em>, 2nd ed. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 4.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p04">The Depression and the post–World War II environments posed special challenges to small business operations. The Hoover and Roosevelt administrations created organizations (the Reconstruction Finance Corporation in 1932 and the Small War Plants Corporation in 1942) to assist small firms. The functions of several government agencies were subsumed into the <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Small Business Administration</a><span class="glossdef">The government agency that is charged with aiding, counseling, assisting, and protecting the interests of small business.</span></span> in 1953. The designated purpose of the SBA was to “aid, counsel, assist and protect, insofar as is possible, the interests of small business concerns.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_011">“What We Do,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Administration</em>, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/what-we-do">www.sba.gov/about-sba-services/what-we-do</a>.</span> The SBA functions to ensure that small businesses have a fair chance at securing government contracts. It also has the responsibility of defining what constitutes a small business.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s01_p05">If anything is to be learned from the passage of all this legislation, it is that, as Conte (2006) eloquently put it, “Americans continued to revere small businesspeople for their self-reliance and independence.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_012">Christopher Conte, “Small Business in U.S. History,” <em class="emphasis">America.gov</em>, January 3, 2006, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080814215602XJyrreP0.6187664.html">www.america.gov/st/business-english/2008/July/20080814215602XJyrreP0.6187664.html</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Definition of Small Business</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p01">The SBA definition of a small business has evolved over time and is dependent on the particular industry. In the 1950s, the SBA defined a <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">small business</a><span class="glossdef">A firm that is independently owned and operated and not dominant in its field of operation. There are variations across industries with respect to competitiveness, entry and exit costs, distribution by size, growth rates, and technological change.</span></span> firm as “independently owned and operated…and not dominant in its field of operation.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_013">Mansel Blackford, <em class="emphasis">The History of Small Business in America</em>, 2nd ed. (Chapel Hill, NC: University of North Carolina Press, 2003), 4.</span> This is still part of their definition. At that time, the SBA classified a small firm as being limited to 250 employees for industrial organizations. Currently, this definition depends on the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) for a business. The SBA recognizes that there are significant differences, across industries, with respect to competitiveness, entry and exit costs, distribution by size, growth rates, and technological change. Although the SBA defines 500 employees as the limit for the majority of industrial firms and receipts of $7 million for the majority of service, retail, and construction firms, there are different values for some industries. <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_t01">Table 1.1 "Examples of Size Limits for Small Businesses by the SBA"</a> presents a selection of different industries and their size limits.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s02_p02">The SBA definition of what constitutes a small business has practical significance. Small businesses have access to an extensive support network provided by the SBA. It runs the SCORE program, which has more than 12,000 volunteers who assist small firms with counseling and training. The SBA also operates Small Business Development Centers, Export Assistance Centers, and Women’s Business Centers. These centers provide comprehensive assistance to small firms. There can be significant economic support for small firms from the SBA. It offers a variety of guaranteed loan programs to start-ups and small firms. It assists small firms in acquiring access to nearly half a trillion dollars in federal contracts. In fact, legislation attempts to target 23 percent of this value for small firms. The SBA can also assist with financial aid following a disaster.</p>

It can be seen that in some industries—construction and real estate—80 percent or more of that industry’s contribution to the GDP comes from small businesses, while in the information industry that number is 20 percent or less.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s03_p02">Few people realize that the overwhelming majority of businesses in the United States are small businesses with fewer than five hundred employees. The SBA puts the number of small businesses at 99.7 percent of the total number of businesses in the United States. However, most of the businesses are nonemployee businesses (i.e., no paid employees) and are home based.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p02">Small business is the great generator of jobs. Recent data indicate that small businesses produced 64 percent of the net new jobs from 1993 to the third quarter of 2008.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_019">“Statistics of U.S. Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">US Census Bureau</em>, April 13, 2010, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/econ/susb">www.census.gov/econ/susb</a>.</span> This is not a recent phenomenon. Thirty years of research studies have consistently indicated that the driving force in fostering new job creation is the birth of new companies and the net additions coming from small businesses. In the 1990s, firms with fewer than twenty employees produced far more net jobs proportionally to their size, and two to three times as many jobs were created through new business formation than through job expansion in small businesses.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_020">William J Dennis Jr., Bruce D. Phillips, and Edward Starr, “Small Business Job Creation: The Findings and Their Critics”, <em class="emphasis">Business Economics</em> 29, no. 3 (1994): 23–30.</span> The US Census Bureau’s Business Dynamics Statistics data confirm that the greatest number of new jobs comes from the creation of new businesses. One can get a sense of the extent of net job change by business size in <a class="xref" href="#cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_t02">Table 1.4 "Job Creation by Firm Size"</a>.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p03">An additional point needs to be made about job creation and loss by small businesses in the context of overall economic conditions. Government data show that of the “net 1.5 million jobs lost in 2008, 64 percent were from small firms.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_021">Brian Headd, “An Analysis of Small Business and Jobs,” <em class="emphasis">Small Business Administration</em>, March 2010, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs359tot.pdf">www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs359tot.pdf</a> (p. 10).</span> However, the same study had some interesting results from the past two recessions. In the 2001 recession, small businesses with fewer than 20 employees experienced 7 percent of the total reduction in jobs, firms with between 20 and 500 employees were responsible for 43 percent of the job losses, and the rest of the job losses came from large firms. As the economy recovered in the following year, firms with fewer than 20 employees created jobs, while the other two groups continued to shed jobs. Following the 1991 recession, it was firms with 20 to 500 employees that were responsible for more than 56 percent of the jobs that were added.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch01_s01_s04_p04">One last area concerning the small business contribution to American employment is its role with respect to minority ownership and employment. During the last decade, there has been a remarkable increase in the number of self-employed individuals. From 2000 to 2007, the number of women who were self-employed increased by 9.7 percent. The number of African Americans who were self-employed increased by 36.6 percent for the same time range. However, the most remarkable number was an increase of nearly 110 percent for Hispanics. It is clear that small business has become an increasingly attractive option for minority groups.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn01_022">“Statistics of U.S. Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">US Census Bureau</em>, April 13, 2010, accessed October 7, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.census.gov/econ/susb">www.census.gov/econ/susb</a>.</span> Women and Hispanics are also employed by small businesses at a higher rate than the national average.</p>
