    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_p02">Many small businesses do not have a marketing plan, choosing instead to market their products and services on an intuitive, sometimes seat-of-the-pants basis. As long as there is regular and effective communication with the rest of the people in the organization, a formal written plan may not be necessary. However, as the business grows and regular and effective communication becomes more difficult, a written marketing plan should be seriously considered. For the small businesses that do have a marketing plan, few actually use it.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_003">Becky McCray, “Simplify Your Small Business Marketing Plan,” <em class="emphasis">Small Biz Survival</em>, February 12, 2010, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbizsurvival.com/2010/02/simplify-your-small-business-marketing.html">www.smallbizsurvival.com/2010/02/simplify-your-small-business-marketing.html</a>.</span></p>
    <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_p03">There are many reasons why so many small businesses do not have marketing plans. Among the reasons are the following:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_004">Adapted from Danielle MacInnis, “74% of Small Business [sic] Have No Marketing Plan!” <em class="emphasis">Marketing Blog for Small Businesses</em>, February 7, 2011, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.daniellemacinnis.com/small-business-marketing/74-of-small-business-have-no-marketing-plan">www.daniellemacinnis.com/small-business-marketing/74-of-small-business -have-no-marketing-plan</a>.</span></p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What Is a Marketing Plan?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p01">A <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">marketing plan</a><span class="glossdef">A written document that summarizes what the marketer has learned about the marketplace and indicates how the firm plans to reach its marketing objectives.</span></span> “is a written document that summarizes what the marketer has learned about the marketplace and indicates how the firm plans to reach its marketing objectives. It contains tactical guidelines for the marketing programs and financial allocations over the planning period.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_005">Philip Kotler and Kevin Lane Keller, <em class="emphasis">Marketing Management</em> (Upper Saddle River, NJ: Pearson Prentice Hall, 2009), 56.</span> A marketing plan provides a specific marketing direction for a small business and is a very valuable tool if it is done correctly. Because the ultimate purpose of the plan is to generate efficient, profitable action, the marketing plan should consist of usable, practical instructions that are designed to ensure that resources are properly applied.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_006">“How to Write Small Business Marketing Plans,” <em class="emphasis">SmallBusiness-Marketing-Plans.com</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusiness-marketing-plans.com">www.smallbusiness-marketing-plans.com</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p02">Marketing plans can range from a one-page summary to more than one hundred pages. Although it is said by some that the ideal marketing plan length for a stand-alone document (i.e., a document that is not part of the total business plan for a company) is twenty to fifty pages,<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_007">“How to Write Small Business Marketing Plans,” <em class="emphasis">SmallBusiness-Marketing-Plans.com</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusiness-marketing-plans.com">www.smallbusiness-marketing-plans.com</a>.</span> the length of a marketing plan for a small business can be any length that will satisfy the needs of the business. The page count of the plan may not be a good way to measure the adequacy of the plan. The marketing plan should be measured by readability and summarization. A good marketing plan will provide the reader with a good general idea of its main contents even after only a quick skim in fifteen minutes or less.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_008">Tim Berry, “How Long Should a Business Plan Be?,” <em class="emphasis">BPlans</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://articles.bplans.com/writing-a-business-plan/how-long-should-a-business-plan-be/49">articles.bplans.com/writing-a-business-plan/how-long-should-a-business -plan-be/49</a>.</span> No matter the length, the plan should be practical, to the point, with useful graphics as appropriate, and worded clearly with no flowery or legalistic language.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_009">“How to Write Small Business Marketing Plans,” <em class="emphasis">SmallBusiness-Marketing-Plans.com</em>, accessed December 2, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.smallbusiness-marketing-plans.com">www.smallbusiness-marketing-plans.com</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p03">The plan should cover one year, which is often the best way to think about marketing for the small company. This is not to say that you should not also think about the long term. It just means that things change more rapidly in the short term. People leave, markets evolve, and customers come and go. Consideration should be given to two to four years down the road.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_010">“How to Create a Marketing Plan,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur</em>, August 7, 2001, accessed June 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/186830">http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/186830</a>.</span></p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s01_p04">Because small business owners have very little time to spend on writing an elaborate marketing plan, it is worth considering using software or online templates to put the plan together. One software program is Marketing Plan Pro, which is now included as part of <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www4.paloalto.com/sales_and_marketing_pro/?gclid=CIz3z7DqnLACFccBRQoddE46aA&lt;">Sales and Marketing Pro</a>.

            <li>You get a higher return on investment (ROI). Every dollar will work harder when it is focused.</li>

            <li>It helps you to establish a timeline, keeping people accountable for the growth and success of operation.</li>

        <h2 class="title editable block">What If There Is No Marketing Plan?</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p01">In <em class="emphasis">Alice in Wonderland</em>, Alice encounters the Cheshire cat. He asks her where she is going. She answers that she does not know. The Cheshire cat answers that any road will take her there. It is clear that Alice did not have a marketing plan. David Campbell has a similar philosophy as reflected in the title of his book: <em class="emphasis">If You Don’t Know Where You’re Going, You’ll Probably End Up Somewhere Else</em>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_014">David Campbell, <em class="emphasis">If You Don’t Know Where You’re Going, You’ll Probably End Up Somewhere Else</em> (Allen, TX: Thomas Moore Publishing, 1974).</span> Without a marketing plan, a small business could be moving at great speed…but in the entirely wrong direction.</p>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p02">Because many small businesses seem to operate successfully without a marketing plan, depending on how you want to define successfully, the absence of a marketing plan does not mean automatic failure. However, there are some distinct disadvantages to not having a marketing plan. The following are some examples:</p>
        <ul class="itemizedlist editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_l01">
            <li>Not having a marketing plan, whether it be a stand-alone document or a section in the business plan, will put you at a significant disadvantage when trying to get any type of business loan.</li>
            <li>Not having a marketing plan can push a business into a meandering mode that could result in slowed growth, missed opportunities, and ignored threats.</li>
            <li>The target market may not be defined correctly.</li>
            <li>Not having a marketing plan may force you to focus on the short term with little or no attention to the long term. This can be devastating to the future of a company.</li>
            <li>Potential efficiencies will not be realized.</li>
            <li>Risk will likely increase.</li>
        </ul>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s01_s03_p03">In short, not having a marketing plan means that you will not realize the advantages of having one. Even if you are an owner-only business, a marketing plan can provide a discipline and a structure for growing the business—if that is desired. On the other hand, if an owner is perfectly satisfied with where and how things are, a marketing plan will most likely not be helpful. Just remember that change is constant. Without a marketing plan, a business may not be ready for change.</p>

                <li>At Frank’s All-American BarBeQue, Frank is pleased with the profitability of the business and the standing that the company has in the local community. Not as pleased is Frank’s son, Robert, who thinks that the business can be bigger and better. The new store that is opening in neighboring Darien, Connecticut, is a good start, but Robert still thinks that the business is not realizing its full potential. A business plan has been prepared except for the marketing plan section. Robert wants to develop the marketing plan for Frank’s, but his father is balking at the idea. His father’s position is, “If it ain’t broke, why fix it?” Taking the position of Robert, make the case for preparing a marketing plan for Frank’s. Think critically when developing your argument, integrating specifics from Frank’s business. Resist the temptation to simply list the advantages of having a plan versus the disadvantages of not having a plan. Frank will need to see something much more persuasive than this.</li>
