The most common forms are sole proprietorship, partnership, and corporation. A limited liability company (LLC) is a relatively new business structure that is now allowed by all fifty states. Before a legal form is selected, however, several factors must be considered, not the least of which are legal and tax options.</p>

        <h2 class="title editable block">Factors to Consider</h2>
        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s03_s01_p01">The legal form of the business is one of the first decisions that a small business owner will have to make. Because this decision will have long-term implications, it is important to consult an attorney and an accountant to help make the right choice. The following are some factors the small business owner should consider before making the choice:<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_104"><a href="http://2012books.lardbucket.org/attribution.html?utm_source=citation">[citation redacted per publisher request]</a>; “Small Business Planner: Choose a Structure,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Association</em>, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/smallbusinessplanner/start/chooseastructure/index.html">archive.sba.gov/smallbusinessplanner/start/chooseastructure/index.html</a>.</span></p>

            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The desired level of control.</strong> Does the owner want to own the business personally or share ownership with others? Does the owner want to share responsibility for operating the business with others?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The level of structure.</strong> What is desired—a very structured organization or something more informal?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">The acceptable liability exposure.</strong> Is the owner willing to risk personal assets? Is the owner willing to accept liability for the actions of others?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Tax implications.</strong> Does the owner want to pay business income taxes and then pay personal income taxes on the profits earned?</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Sharing profits.</strong> Does the owner want to share the profits with others or personally keep them?</li>
            <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Financing needs.</strong> Can the owner provide all the financing needs or will outside investors be needed? If outside investors are needed, how easy will it be to get them?</li>
            <li>

No choice will be perfect. Even after a business structure is determined, the favorability of that choice over another will always be subject to changes in the laws.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn12_105">“Limited Liability Company,” <em class="emphasis">Entrepreneur.com</em>, July 9, 2007, accessed February 3, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.entrepreneur.com/article/24484">www.entrepreneur.com/article/24484</a>.</span></p>

            <h3 class="title">Key Takeaways</h3>
            <ul class="itemizedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_l01">
                <li>Every small business must select a legal form of ownership. It is one of the first decisions that a small business owner must make.</li>
                <li>The most common forms of legal structure are the sole proprietorship, the partnership, and the corporation. An LLC is a relatively new business structure.</li>
                <li>When deciding on a legal structure, every small business owner must consider several important factors before making the choice.</li>
                <li>The sole proprietorship is the oldest, simplest, and cheapest form of business ownership. This business structure accounts for the largest number of businesses but the lowest amount of revenue. This is the choice for most small businesses.</li>
                <li>A partnership is two or more people voluntarily operating a business as co-owners for profit. There are general partnerships and limited partnerships.</li>
                <li>A corporation is an artificial person with most of the legal rights of a real person. Corporations make up about 20 percent of all businesses in the United States, but they account for almost 90 percent of the revenue.</li>
                <li>Small businesses that are incorporated outperform unincorporated small businesses in terms of profitability, employment growth, sales growth, and other measures.</li>
                <li>The LLC is a hybrid of a sole proprietorship and a corporation. It is the best choice for most small businesses.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3 class="title">Exercises</h3>
            <ol class="orderedlist" id="cadden_1.0-ch12_s03_s05_l02">
                <li>Select three small businesses of different sizes: small, medium, and large. Interview the owners, asking each about the legal structure that the owner chose and why. If any of the businesses are sole proprietorships, ask the owner if an LLC was considered. If not, try to find out why it was not considered.</li>
                <li>Frank’s BarBeQue is currently a sole proprietorship. Frank’s son, Robert, is trying to persuade his father to either incorporate or become an LLC. Assume that you are Robert. Make a case for each legal structure and then make a recommendation to Frank. It is expected that you will go beyond the textbook in researching your response to this assignment.</li>
