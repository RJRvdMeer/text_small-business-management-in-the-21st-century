                <li>The product or the company name must translate flawlessly to the new target market so that it does not convey an unintended, perhaps very negative, meaning. One of the most well-known examples of a translation blunder is the Chevy Nova. In Spanish, “nova” means “no go.”</li>
                <li>The package label may need to be changed.

<strong class="emphasis bold">Internationalize website content.</strong> A business must account for language differences, and cultural differences may require different graphics and different colors. One way to deal with the additional costs is to translate text or provide country-specific sites only for the country or countries where the most products are sold. One organization that provides resources to help businesses localize their products and resources is the <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.gala-global.org">Globalization and Localization Association</a>.</li>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Calculate the buyer’s costs and estimate shipping.</strong> Shipping internationally will take longer, is more complicated, and will be more expensive than shipping domestically. Fortunately, there are shipping management software packages available that will automatically figure the costs and delivery times for overseas orders, giving a close estimate. Large shipping carriers, such as UPS and FedEx, offer such software; other companies include E4X Inc., eCustoms, and Kewill Systems Plc.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_070">Paul Demery, “Anchors Aweigh,” <em class="emphasis">Internet Retailer</em>, January 31, 2008, accessed February 7, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.internetretailer.com/2008/01/31/anchors-aweigh">www.internetretailer.com/2008/01/31/anchors-aweigh</a>.</span>
</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Optimize site and search marketing for international web visitors.</strong> With the increase in cross-border selling, websites can be optimized for visitors from specific countries, and techniques can be used to attract international visitors through search engines and search ads. This is a growing specialty among search marketers. A business should definitely check out the cost of hiring such a marketer as a consultant. It would be well worth the investment.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Comply with government export regulations.</strong> A business does not need government approval to sell most goods and services across international borders. There are, of course, notable exceptions. For example, the US government restricts defense or military goods, and agricultural, plant, and food items may have restrictions or special labeling requirements. Such restrictions should be addressed on the website. It may be necessary to restrict the sale of certain products to certain countries only.</li>

Cultural, social, language, and legal differences from country to country will usually make it necessary to modify IMC messages to not offend current or prospective customers.

The actual mix will be a function of the selected country or countries.

Consider the characteristics of the target market, how the market uses media in that country, and which media are actually available. Some countries do not have commercial television, and some do not have advertising in newspapers. There will be newspaper and magazine circulation differences from country to country; in countries with a low literacy rate, radio and television advertising (if available) will be more effective than print media.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_096">John M.

Each IMC component is a communication channel in its own right. A business must consider the appropriateness of each message in each channel. For example, is the message adequate? Does it contain correct cultural interpretations? Are the colors and graphics right? In the case of advertising, have the media been chosen that match the behavior of the intended audience?

<strong class="emphasis bold">The risks associated with financing the transaction.</strong> The riskier the transaction, the more difficult and costly it will be for a business to finance it because there will likely be a higher chance for default.

In risky situations, the financing provider may require the most secure method of payment—a letter of credit or export credit insurance.</li>

The difficulties they experience in obtaining both trade finance and working capital often prevent small businesses from financing purchases by foreign buyers.

                    <li>Expanding into global markets introduces new complexities into small business operations.</li>
                    <li>The decision to go global should be based on an assessment of the ways to export, an analysis of the industry and a particular company, marketing and cultural factors, legal and political conditions, currency exchange rates, and sources of financing.</li>
                    <li>There are two basic ways to export: direct or indirect. In direct exporting, a small business exports directly to a customer who is interested in buying the product. Indirect exporting involves using a middleman for marketing and selling the product in the target market.</li>
                    <li>Industry analysis involves looking at where an industry currently is and the trends and directions predicted over the next three years so that a business can try to determine how competitive an industry is in the global market.</li>
                    <li>It is important to honestly self-evaluate a business to determine whether it is ready to go global or not.</li>
                    <li>It will generally be necessary to adapt the marketing mix to the global market in general and different countries in particular.</li>
                    <li>Legal issues include international trade laws, tax laws, and local regulations.</li>
                    <li>No small business can conduct global business without understanding the influence of the political environments in which it will be operating.</li>
                    <li>Currency exchange rates are important because currency fluctuations can present additional problems for a small business that is looking to go global. In particular, the appreciation and depreciation of a currency will have an effect on the prices of goods and services.</li>
                    <li>How a business finances an export project is often a critical factor in its success.</li>
                    <li>Working capital is needed before and after the sale, and money is needed until the goods and services that have been provided have been paid for.</li>
                    <li>Many—perhaps most—of the sources for small business exporting activity are governmental.</li>

                    <li>Comment on the following: a small business owner firmly believes that because a product is successful in Chicago, Illinois, it will be successful in Tokyo or Berlin.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_118">Adapted from Philip R. Cateora and John L. Graham, <em class="emphasis">International Marketing</em> (New York: McGraw-Hill Irwin, 2007), 367.</span> Be as specific as you can in your comments.</li>
                    <li>There has been tremendous growth in online business, which has introduced new elements to the legal climate of global business. Patents, brand names, copyrights, and trademarks are difficult to monitor because there are no boundaries with the Internet. What steps could a small business take to protect its trademarks and brands in this environment? Prepare at least five suggestions.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn15_119">David L. Kurtz, <em class="emphasis">Contemporary Business</em> (Hoboken, NJ: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011), 133.</span>
</li>
                    <li>Find a local small business that exports its products. Talk to the owner about his or her experiences. Ask questions such as the following: What convinced you to export? How did you decide on the product(s) to export? Did you have to adapt your product(s) in any way? What were the greatest barriers you had to face?</li>
