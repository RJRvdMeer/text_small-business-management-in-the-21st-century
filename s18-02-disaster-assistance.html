        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_p01">In the case of a physical disaster, a small business owner may apply for a low-interest SBA loan of up to $2 million to repair or replace damaged real estate, equipment, inventory, and fixtures: “The loan may be increased by as much as 20 percent of the total amount of disaster damage to real estate and/or leasehold improvements, as verified by SBA, to protect property against future disasters of the same type. These loans will cover uninsured and or under-insured losses.”<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_036">“Disaster Assistance For Businesses of All Sizes,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, accessed February 28, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_da_dprep_factsheethome.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_da _dprep_factsheethome.pdf</a>.</span> It is also possible that small business disaster relief loans may be available at the local, county, regional, or state level.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_037">See, for example, the small business loans that are available through the Union County Economic Development Corporation (Union, New Jersey) for disaster assistance: <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://scotchplains.patch.com/articles/union-county-makes-small-business-loans-available">scotchplains.patch.com/articles/union-county-makes-small-business-loans -available</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s02_s01_p03">The interest rate on both Physical and Economic Injury Disaster Loans will not exceed 4 percent if you do not have credit available elsewhere. Repayment can be up to 30 years, but this will depend on the business’s ability to repay the loan. For businesses that may have credit available elsewhere, the interest rate will not exceed 8 percent. SBA determines whether the applicant has credit available elsewhere.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_039">“Disaster Assistance For Businesses of All Sizes,” <em class="emphasis">US Small Business Administration</em>, accessed February 28, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_da_dprep_factsheethome.pdf">archive.sba.gov/idc/groups/public/documents/sba_homepage/serv_da _dprep_factsheethome.pdf</a>.</span></p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch14_s02_s02_p01">The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) provides some disaster assistance and emergency relief for businesses through special tax law provisions, especially when the federal government declares their location to be a major disaster area.

While doing disaster planning, check the latest special tax law provisions that may help a business recover financially from the impact of a major disaster.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn14_040">“Disaster Assistance and Emergency Relief for Individuals and Businesses,” <em class="emphasis">Internal Revenue Service</em>, accessed February 6, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=156138,00.html">www.irs.gov/businesses/small/article/0,,id=156138,00.html</a>.</span> It would also be a good idea to check out what kind of record keeping the IRS requires so that a business will be fully prepared should it be necessary to take advantage of what the IRS offers.</p>
