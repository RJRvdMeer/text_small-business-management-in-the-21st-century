Even a niche market must be large enough to offer profitability potential. At the same time, a company will want the market to grow so that the business can grow (assuming growth is desired). If, on the other hand, a company wants to remain small, market growth is not as important—except that it may present opportunities for new competitors to enter the marketplace.</li>

                    <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_s01_p03">In 2010, the global pasta market reached $8 billion. Pasta sales are estimated to grow by at least 10 percent for the next few years. This growth can be attributed to several different factors. The first factor is an appreciation for health-conscious food. Although not all pasta is “good for you,” particularly cream-based sauces, pasta can be very tasty yet health conscious at the same time. Pasta is seen as a healthy food because of its high percentage of carbohydrates relative to fat.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_s01_p04">Another variable that contributes to market growth is an increase in the number of hours our demographic is working. Over the last five years, the number of hours spent at work of our archetype customer has significantly increased. As the number of work hours increases, there is a high correlation of people who eat out at restaurants. This is intuitively explained by the fact that with a limited number of hours available each day, people have less time to prepare their meals, and eating out is one way to maximize their time.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_034">Adapted from “Pasta Restaurant Marketing Plan: Sigmund’s Gourmet Pasta,” <em class="emphasis">Mplans.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php">www.mplans.com/pasta _restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php</a>.</span></p>

<strong class="emphasis bold">Health consciousness.</strong> As Americans in general are more cognizant of their health, evidenced by the increase in individuals exercising and health-club memberships, patrons are requesting more healthy alternatives when they eat out.

                    <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s01_s01_p07">The reason for this trend is that within the last few years, restaurant offerings have increased, providing customers with new choices. Restaurant patrons no longer need to accept a limited number of options. With more choices, patrons have become more sophisticated. This trend is intuitive as you can observe a more sophisticated patron in larger city markets such as Seattle, Portland, or New York, where there are more choices. People are also increasingly expecting a web presence for restaurants. This presence includes a website, a membership on Facebook, and oftentimes a Twitter presence. The importance of a website and the use of social media cannot be underestimated.</p>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s02_p01">Every marketing plan should include an assessment of the competition: who they are, what they offer, their growth rates (if known), and their market share (if known). Market share is defined as the percentage of total sales volume in a market that is captured by a brand, a product, or a company.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_037">“Market Share,” <em class="emphasis">BusinessDictionary.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.businessdictionary.com/definition/market-share.html">www.businessdictionary.com/definition/market-share.html</a>.</span> Think of the market as a pie, with each slice being a “share” of that pie. The larger the slice, the larger the percentage of sales volume captured by a brand, a product, or a company. With all this knowledge, a business will be in the best position to differentiate itself in the marketplace. However, while the sales figures of a business are easily accessible, it is not likely that the owner will have either total market sales figures or growth rate, sales figures, and market share information for the competition. This information, if available at all, is usually available from trade associations and market research firms,<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_038">“Market Share,” <em class="emphasis">QuickMBA</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.quickmba.com/marketing/market-share">www.quickmba.com/marketing/market-share</a>.</span> with the likelihood being even less if the information desired is about other small businesses. Competitor websites and Internet searches may prove helpful, but because most small businesses are privately held, the information available online will be limited. As a result, you will be restricted in the information that you can collect about the competition to things that can easily be observed in person or are available on company websites. Examples include product selection, price points, service quality, and product quality.</p>
            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s02_p02">Competition should be addressed in terms of being direct or indirect. <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">Direct competition</a><span class="glossdef">Competition from similar businesses or products.</span></span> refers to competition from similar businesses or products, whereas <span class="margin_term"><a class="glossterm">indirect competition</a><span class="glossdef">Competition from alternative, substitutable businesses or products.</span></span> refers to competition from alternative, substitutable businesses or products. In the case of Sigmund’s Gourmet Pasta, direct competition would come from other restaurants that serve pasta. Indirect competition would come from other types of full-service restaurants, fast food, the freezer- or prepared-foods areas in the grocery store, delis, preparation services that target the home, and even online businesses that sell prepared foods (<a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.dinewise.com">DineWise</a>).

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s03_s03_p01">The marketing plan must be very clear about the product or the service that is being offered to the marketplace because the product drives the creation of the marketing mix and the marketing strategy. An error in product identification and definition can wreak havoc in the company and in the marketplace because misdirected marketing actions can occur. The responsibility for the product definitions rests squarely with the owner. For example, if a business is a live theater that features very sophisticated plays, would you define the product as entertainment or art? The answer to this question will have major implications for a company’s marketing strategy.</p>

                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s04_p03">The single objective is to position Sigmund’s as the premier gourmet pasta restaurant in the Eugene, Oregon, area, commanding a majority of the market share within five years. The marketing strategy will seek to first create customer awareness regarding the services offered, develop that customer base, and work toward building customer loyalty and referrals.</p>
                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s04_p04">The message that Sigmund’s will seek to communicate is that Sigmund’s offers the freshest, most creative, health-conscious, reasonably priced, gourmet pasta in Eugene. This message will be communicated through a variety of methods. The first will be direct mail. The direct mail campaign will be a way to communicate directly with the consumer. Sigmund’s will also use banner ads and inserts in the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em>. This will be particularly effective because the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em> is a popular local paper that is consulted when people are looking for things to do in Eugene. The restaurant’s website will also encourage patronage because the warm and friendly atmosphere of the site will reflect the atmosphere of the actual restaurant. Facebook and Twitter followers along with customer comments will also add to brand awareness.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_067">The website and social media are additions to “Pasta Restaurant Marketing Plan: Sigmund’s Gourmet Pasta,” <em class="emphasis">Mplans.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php">www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php</a>.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s04_p05">The last method for communicating Sigmund’s message is through a grassroots PR campaign. This campaign will leverage personal relationships with people on the staff of the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em> to get a couple of articles written about Sigmund’s. One will be from the business point of view, talking about the opening of the restaurant and the people behind the venture. This is likely to be run in the business section. The second article will be a food review. In speaking with many different retailers and restaurateurs, significant increases of traffic have followed articles in the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em>. Because of this level of effectiveness and low/zero cost, Sigmund’s will work hard to get press in the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em>.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_068">“Pasta Restaurant Marketing Plan: Sigmund’s Gourmet Pasta,” <em class="emphasis">Mplans.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php">www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php</a>.</span></p>

                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Distribution.</strong> Sigmund’s food will be distributed through a model in which customers can either call in their orders or place them online<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_070">The authors of this textbook added the capability to place an order online.</span> and come to the restaurant to pick them up or come into the restaurant, place their orders, and wait for them to be completed.</li>
                    <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Advertising and promotion.</strong> The most successful advertising will be banner ads and inserts in the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em> as well as a PR campaign of informational articles and reviews within the <em class="emphasis">Register Guard</em> and coupons available on the website. The first-timer discount coupon and code will be prominently displayed on the website’s home page to encourage prospects to become customers. Coupons will also be available for repeat customers once per month.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_071">The addition of coupons is a combination of ideas from the authors of this textbook and the following sample marketing plan: “Restaurant Marketing Plan: Neon Memories Diner,” <em class="emphasis">MPlans.com</em>, accessed June 1, 2012, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mplans.com/restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_vision_fc.php">http://www.mplans.com/restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_vision_fc.php</a>.</span> Holiday specials will be offered on Valentine’s Day, Easter, Mother’s Day, and Father’s Day.</li>

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s06_p01">Marketing research is about gathering the information that is needed to make business decisions, which should be an ongoing process. A marketing plan should be based on marketing research. The research can range from something very simple conducted by the owner or an employee to a more sophisticated study that is prepared by a marketing research firm. The overall goal of the research, however, is to help a company offer products that people will want, at an appealing price, in the place where they want to buy them. The research should also help a company decide how to promote its products so that people will be aware of them. People cannot buy what they do not know about.</p>

                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s06_p02">During the initial phases of developing the marketing plan, several focus groups were held to gain insight into a variety of patrons of restaurants. These focus groups provided useful insight into the decisions and decision-making processes of consumers.</p>
                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s06_p03">An additional source of dynamic market research is a feedback mechanism based on a suggestion card system. The suggestion card system has several statements that patrons are asked to rate in terms of a given scale. There are also several open-ended questions that allow the customer to freely offer constructive criticism or praise. Sigmund’s will work hard to implement reasonable suggestions to improve its service offerings as well as show its commitment to customers that their suggestions are valued. This suggestion system will also be incorporated into our website so that customers can provide feedback online.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_074">The authors of this textbook added the online suggestion system.</span></p>
                <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s04_s06_p04">The last source of market research is competitive analysis and appreciation. Sigmund’s will continually patronize local restaurants for two reasons. The first is for competitive analysis, providing Sigmund’s with timely information regarding the service offerings of other restaurants. The second reason is that local business owners, particularly restaurant owners, are often part of an informal fraternal organization where they support each other.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_075">“Pasta Restaurant Marketing Plan: Sigmund’s Gourmet Pasta,” <em class="emphasis">Mplans.com</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php">www.mplans.com/pasta_restaurant_marketing_plan/marketing_strategy_fc.php</a>.</span></p>

The evaluation process, if done correctly, will allow a company to continually improve its tactics and assess the results of its marketing efforts. Thus it is important to set up a timely process to track, capture, and analyze collected data as it is collected. If this is done on a regular basis, a marketing activity (e.g., banner advertising) that doesn’t work can be changed to more effective tactics (e.g., advertising in the local paper) that do work.<span class="footnote" id="cadden_1.0-fn08_095">“Marketing Plan: Evaluation,” <em class="emphasis">Will It Fly</em>, accessed December 1, 2011, <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.willitfly.com/wif/educelbrief.jsp?briefId=93&amp;sponsorId=61&amp;modId=241&amp;modNm=Marketing%2BPlan&amp;sectionNm=Evaluation">www.willitfly.com/wif/educelbrief.jsp?briefId=93&amp;sponsorId=61&amp;modId=241&amp; modNm=Marketing%2BPlan&amp;sectionNm=Evaluation</a>.</span></p>

                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Look at sales (or fee) income.</strong> Sales or fee income should be increasing. However, some small businesses will have longer sales cycles than others, so it might be better to measure the number of new leads generated, or the number of appointments, or the number of billable hours achieved. Also remember that discounts, variances in fees, and promotional pricing will affect total sales volume. If a company is selling online and onground, look at the path of both income streams.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Ask clients or customers.</strong> Find out where and how clients and customers heard about the business. Most businesses never ask this question, so they miss out on valuable insights into how clients and customers pick a product or a service.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does advertising and/or promotional activity produce direct responses?</strong> It should. If not, a company should work to find out why not. This is also relevant for a web presence. A company should want to know how site visitors found out about the company.</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Check the conversion rate.</strong> How successful is a business at closing the sale? Has it improved? If a company is selling online, how many site visitors are actually buying something?</li>
                <li>
<strong class="emphasis bold">Does the plan have a positive return on investment (ROI)?</strong> Does it bring in enough new or repeat business to justify the expense? A company should evaluate the cost-effectiveness of each specific online and onground marketing activity so that it can change or eliminate unproductive activities. There are online tools available to help companies with this evaluation. As an example, a free ROI calculator is available at <a class="link" target="_blank" href="http://www.cymbic.com/tools/roi_calc.php">www.cymbic.com/tools/roi_calc.php</a>.</li>

The data and techniques will vary widely depending on product type and market—and whether a company has an online presence only or both an onground presence and an online presence. However, most small businesses should select the simplest route possible because of the lower costs and the limited need for very sophisticated tracking. The following are some common and very doable tracking techniques for the small business:</p>

A good schedule and budget should make it easy to monitor progress, but when things fall behind schedule or there are cost overruns, you must be ready to do something about it and adapt the plan accordingly. From time to time, the owner must step back and ask whether the plan is working.

            <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch08_s02_s06_s04_p02">In addition to setting a schedule and measuring and evaluating the effectiveness of marketing activities, a marketing plan needs to say how it will be controlled. Although there are many approaches to control, the small business owner will likely look to activities such as sales analysis (monthly and annual revenue), expense analysis (monthly and annual expenses), feedback from customer satisfaction surveys, and the observation of competitor activities in response to the marketing plan (marketing research). The organization of the marketing function itself can also be seen as a means of control.</p>

Implementation was discussed previously. Contingency planning is a formal process to manage a crisis, whether it comes from inside or outside a company.

                    <li>There is no universally accepted format for a marketing plan. The plan can be a stand-alone document or a section of the business plan.</li>
                    <li>A marketing plan has several critical sections: executive summary; vision and mission; situation analysis; marketing objectives; marketing strategy; financials; and implementation, evaluation, and control.</li>
                    <li>The executive summary is a one- to two-page synopsis of the marketing plan.</li>
                    <li>The vision statement tries to articulate the long-term purpose and idealized notion of what a business hopes to be—that is, where the owner sees the business going.</li>
                    <li>The mission statement looks to articulate the more fundamental nature of a business—that is, why the business exists.</li>
                    <li>The situation analysis gives a picture of where a business is now in the market and provides the context for marketing efforts. This analysis includes a market summary, competition, product offerings, the SWOT analysis, keys to success, and critical issues.</li>
                    <li>The marketing strategy section of the plan involves selecting one or more target markets, deciding how to differentiate and position a product or a service, and creating and maintaining a marketing mix that will hopefully prove successful with the selected target market(s)—all within the context of marketing objectives. It also includes a web strategy for small businesses that have or want to have a web presence.</li>
                    <li>The financials section of the marketing plan should provide a financial overview of a company as it relates to its marketing activities. For the small business, this should typically include a breakeven analysis, a sales and direct cost of sales forecast, and a forecast of marketing expenses.</li>
                    <li>The implementation, evaluation, and control section of the marketing plan should include how a company will put the plan into action, evaluate whether the plan is working, and monitor and adjust implementation of the plan through marketing plan controls.</li>
