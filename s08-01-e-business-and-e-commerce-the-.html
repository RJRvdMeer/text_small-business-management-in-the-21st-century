Small businesses that are nonemployers and/or are very small operations that choose to stay that way—for example, local delis, gift shops, restaurants, dry cleaners, and ice cream shops can be and are successful without having to make a commitment to e-business. Therefore, a small business can choose to incorporate all, some, or none of the e-business components. Given the ways in which the Internet continues to transform small businesses, however, it would be virtually impossible for a small business to operate totally outside the realm of e-business.</p>

        <p class="para editable block" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s01_s03_p01">The decision to engage in e-commerce is an important one. The advantages are clear: lower business costs; 24/7 accessibility anywhere; the potential for stronger customer service; the ability to introduce a niche product; the ability to reach global markets on a more equalized basis with larger firms, making mass customization possible; and greater customer loyalty. But the risks are there as well. Internet problems, website problems, security and privacy breaches, intellectual property theft, legal liability, product and/or service failure, customer deceit, and customer dissatisfaction are but a few of the risks. Therefore, the choice of an e-commerce business model must be made carefully. Each model will have different implications in terms of business planning and strategy.</p>

                    <p class="para">Joan Watson is the owner of Joan’s Gourmet Baskets, a small brick-and-mortar business that specializes in gourmet gift and picnic baskets. Joan has been keeping up with the fancy food and gourmet food trends (being a great fan of the Fancy Food Show that is held several times a year), and she thinks she should tap into this sector by creating an online business that will complement her physical business. This would make her baskets available to a wider market. She is proud of the quality of her products and the customer loyalty that she has earned through her hard work and hopes she will be able to be just as successful in the e-commerce environment.</p>
                    <p class="para" id="cadden_1.0-ch04_s01_s05_p02">Joan knows that she needs more information before proceeding further. She has asked you to prepare a report that answers the following questions: How will her physical business compare to her online business; that is, where will things be the same, and where will they be different? What business model should she use? What are the special challenges and obstacles she will face as she moves from traditional commerce to e-commerce? What is Web 2.0 all about and does she need to be concerned about it? She expects that you will do additional gourmet foods research to support your ideas.</p>
